    "content": "In a world where governments already redistribute income with all of the inefficiency that comes with overlapping bureaucracies, frequently resulting a very mediocre welfare system, the notion of direct cash payments has some appeal due to its relative simplicity and fairness. For many, it is certainly preferable to the current system. The appeal of a UBI isn’t really about shrinking the size of government. The program cost would be quite large if the monthly payment is around $1,000 and universal, even though the number of public employees required to administer a true UBI system would be smaller than the army of bureaucrats that taxpayers currently employ to administer the welfare system. For many, an interest in UBI also comes from the perception that welfare programs are demeaning and paternalistic by design. These current programs dictate to poor people what to spend on food, housing, or health care instead of allowing them to determine those trade-offs. In other words, if you believe that all individuals have the capacity to promote their own interests and are, in fact, better able to make decisions about their own lives than anyone else (like government bureaucrats), UBI should pique your curiosity. But a UBI program does have features that are problematic.As George Mason University economist Bryan Caplan has noted, a system that taxes everyone in order to redistribute to everyone is nonsensical in and of itself. Then there is the fact that in places where it has actually been tried, UBI has created some disincentives to work. But that’s hardly a surprise since most welfare programs, including the earned income tax credit, also have this downside. The real question is whether or not UBI is worse than the current system as a whole. One thing is for sure, as a two-year experiment in Finland demonstrated: We know that UBI doesn’t compel people to work. But there are additional concerns surrounding UBI, which are deal-breakers for me. Without a strong guarantee that all anti-poverty measures would be terminated — and that they will not be brought back to life later — UBI is a terrible idea. Under such circumstances, UBI won’t live up to one of its chief selling points, namely, to serve as a more efficient substitute for the highly inefficient welter of existing welfare programs and to do it in a simple and uniform manner. Herein lies a lot of the problem with the Spanish scheme. For starters, it’s not universal. It’s means-tested, which is to say that the UBI recipients must demonstrate they lack a certain level of wealth or income. This defeats the universal and simple aspects of the system. In addition, Spain’s UBI program would be added on top of existing welfare programs, so it only makes existing programs more complicated, more bureaucratic, and more expensive. A few years ago, George Mason University’s Peter Boettke and Adam Martin of Kings College in London wrote, The most robust protection against poverty comes from institutions that generate a harmony of interests rather than those that foment distributional conflicts. A guaranteed income may or may not be an improvement over the current state of affairs, but either way, a massive wealth transfer and regulatory state harms the poor."

    "content": "Some people just don’t know when to quit. Despite the historic failures of Communism, and recent rebukes to socialism such as Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, the far left has concocted yet another harebrained scheme aimed at ensuring that society remains forever dependent on the meager allowances of government. This latest leftist incarnation, known as Universal Basic Income, is little more than socialism on steroids — it grants every citizen, regardless of employment status, social status, or income the same government stipend on which to (supposedly) live. The collectivists’ boogeyman this time around is technology, specifically the idea that automation and artificial intelligence will soon take so many jobs that governments the world over will have no choice but to tax the owners of these technologies egregiously and distribute the wealth to the unemployable masses. Talk about a vision of hope! And just as some people never quit, it seems others never learn — despite UBI’s absurdity, the idea is slowly but surely gaining traction. From the snowy steppes of Finland and Canada to more tropical climes in Brazil, communities across the globe are now flirting with UBI-inspired disaster out of fear that humans will soon have no way to earn a living because robots have taken all the jobs. Even worse, scientific geniuses such as Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla fame have begun to endorse an idea that — according to all historical evidence — is bad science. And while rich celebrities’ penchant for socialism is neither new nor great cause for alarm, as automation and AI ramp up and continue to dominate headlines, the threat of UBI as actual policy may well grow in proportion. While proponents of UBI point to its support among both the far left as well as segments of the right, including Charles Murray who referenced it as a possible means to reduce bureaucracy and eliminate the corrupt third parties that benefit from the welfare state, there is little they can do to deny the failures of similar past programs and the innate need of humans to work and produce in order to lead full lives. Proponents such as Murray would have us believe that America is better off with everyone on welfare, rather than certain segments of society. Unfortunately, history proves otherwise. If previous experiments in government-issued income have taught us anything, it’s that people can learn to live off the most meager means. Consider the abject failure of the decades-long War on Poverty, in which entitlement programs with price tags exceeding America’s current GDP have had very little effect on the poverty rate. In fact, LBJ’s trademark disaster provides the perfect rebuttal to one of UBI’s central tenets: that by lifting the burdens imposed by welfare, such as constant justification to remain on the dole, recipients will have more free time to pursue other interests, including employment. While it may sound somewhat reasonable, the numbers from the War on Poverty tell a very different story: from 1960-1991, the percentage of working breadwinners among the poorest 20 percent of families was cut in half because, well, they didn’t have to work. Rather they subsisted on what Uncle Sam would give them, which was just enough to survive but insufficient to thrive. So much for entrepreneurship.Beyond the catch a fish for a man/teach a man to fish debate, however, is the larger point that working is imperative to the human condition. As the Lebanese-American poet Kahlil Gibran proclaims in his trademark work The Prophet: You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth. For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life’s procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite. Melodrama aside, Gibran, like so many others, knew well that work was intrinsically linked to self-worth, and that to not work was harmful to one’s wellbeing. There’s no shortage of science equating unemployment with a number of society’s most serious ills, including addiction and depression. These afflictions often lead to tragedy, and a 2015 study found unemployment responsible for one in five suicides globally. The consequences of ill-advised and mismanaged welfare programs have been documented for decades, and there’s simply no reason to believe that the outcomes of what is essentially welfare for all will be any different. Let’s face it: UBI is little more than a cocktail of Communist, Luddite, and Malthusian paranoias, rehashed to prey upon the fears of an uncertain, automated future. But futures have always been uncertain, and historically speaking, innovation and automation have consistently led to greater prosperity; from the Industrial Revolution to the assembly line to the Internet, there have always been John Henry-types preaching dire warnings about the threats posed to labor by technology. Musk and his far-left cohorts are no different, and they too will be proven incorrect. Make no mistake, automation and AI will certainly shake up the workforce. And, as always, there will be winners and losers, but we will adapt. If anything we should be training future generations to harness AI and automation for the greater human good, not dressing up historically disastrous economic schemes for fear of fictional robot overlords. As famous futurist and director of engineering at Google Ray Kurzweil observed: You can point to jobs that are going to go away from automation, but don’t worry, we’re going to invent new jobs. People say, What new jobs? I don’t know. They haven’t been invented yet. Sixty-five percent of Americans today work at information jobs that didn’t exist 25 years ago, two-thirds of the population in 1900 worked either on farms or on factories.… We’re constantly inventing new things to do with our time, but you can’t really define that because the future hasn’t been invented yet. But the past has. And if it has taught us anything, it’s that we need not repeat the same mistakes for fear of a future that always seems to adapt to technological progress."

    "title": "Basic Income Madness",
    "source": "The American Spectator",
    "author": "STEVEN GREENHUT",
    "URL": "https://spectator.org/universal-basic-income-california/",
    "content": "Sacramento California’s legislative analysts and Capitol staffers do a remarkably thorough job summarizing proposed bills in their publicly available reports, but it’s still unusual to see them cite the work of free-market economists. It’s obvious why. Almost every new measure emanating from our progressive Legislature would expand the size of government and limit the role of the private sector. In its report on legislation to create a universal basic income (UBI), the Assembly Committee on Human Services quoted from Stanford University’s Basic Income Lab. Such proposals were very much alive in the early second half of the 20th century — including through figures like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Milton Friedman as a way to deal with wealth inequalities, it explained. As has been reported widely, the Legislature has passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities the first-in-the-nation statewide basic income plan that would give direct cash payments to a targeted group of Californians. In this case, the primary recipients are recently emancipated foster youth. That’s a worthy group in need of help, and the bill is a limited pilot program. But there’s no doubt that lawmakers have grand designs for this idea — and are building off of local pilot projects that started in Stockton and spread to a few Bay Area cities. UBI is a terrible idea, and it’s not entirely accurate to put the late Nobel economist on the side of such proposals. In the 1960s, Friedman proposed the negative income tax, which is a variant of these kinds of universal basic income proposals. Friedman acknowledged that some form of welfare was necessary in capitalist societies and that the state would likely play a role in its provision, explained Guy Sorman in a 2011 article in City Journal. The trick was to imagine a very different, radically improved, and more efficient form of welfare, Sorman added. This direct cash grant would replace all other welfare programs for the poor, which, Friedman rightly observed, were generating a huge bureaucracy and extensive welfare dependency. Ever the creative thinker, Friedman was looking to dislodge the current bureaucratic system with market-oriented alternatives. Progressives have rediscovered these direct-payment ideas as Americans have softened up to the notion of direct payments after more than a year of COVID-19 shutdowns. Some free-marketers have reluctantly supported those payments simply because the government forcibly shut down people’s private businesses and jobs. Those direct payments were akin to compensation for a taking, but few of us argue that it’s an ideal situation. These guaranteed-income ideas — whether offering direct, unrestricted cash payments to targeted groups or to broader swaths of society — embrace the easy half of what Friedman had proposed and then conveniently ignore the tougher half. He wasn’t advocating a vast expansion of welfare payments — but replacing the gargantuan social-services bureaucracies with a system that was simpler, less costly, and encouraged individual responsibility. This idea serves as a useful thought experiment, but it wasn’t to see what was coming. For instance, Senate Bill 739 explains, To the extent authorized under federal law, the universal basic income provided by this project shall not be considered income or resources for purposes of determining eligibility to receive benefits or the amount of those benefits under the follow public social services, programs and financial aid. That following list is extensive and includes most of the existing programs available to Californians. Clearly, this proposal would offer a payment on top of everything else and wouldn’t replace anything. California’s vast array of public employees needn’t fear for their jobs. The private foundation that funded the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) that jump-started these UBI discussions a few years ago was also clear about its objectives: We at SEED firmly believe that unconditional cash must supplement, rather than replace, the existing social safety net. As such, SEED took a series of steps, based on conversations with legal counsel, social service administrators, and other cash transfer pilots, to protect against potential benefits losses. Obviously, this is about expanding the welfare state, not reforming it. Certainly, private foundations can do as they choose, but this program offers the blueprint for taxpayer-supported programs such as the one approved by the Legislature. SEED and others have touted their success stories, but it’s not surprising that people who receive extra monthly cash are happy about their improved financial situation. The problems are obvious. Small pilot programs aren’t going to impose major financial commitments on state and local governments, but they also aren’t going to boost the economic prospects for many people. California has the highest cost-of-living-adjusted poverty rate in America. There’s not enough money in Sacramento to make a dent in poverty this way. UBI sends the wrong message. As the Orange County Register opined, It’s wrong to condition an ever-expanding swath of Americans to look toward the government for their sustenance. Employers already struggle to find sufficient workers because of generous COVID-19-related stimulus checks. These programs provide immediate help — but dissuade people from getting the job skills that will improve their long-term economic prospects. Some support for UBI comes from Bay Area tech leaders who, as that Stanford report quoted by the Assembly notes, fear that automation may displace workers from the labor market at unprecedented rates. In that case, UBI attempts to buy social peace by providing cash rather than opportunities to low-skilled workers. We can do better than that. California’s progressive legislators continually drive up the cost of doing business through their endless tax increases and regulatory requirements, and they drive up the cost of living (especially housing) and destroy jobs with similar policies. Then they bemoan growing poverty rates and try to compensate with a series of additional handouts. Universal basic income is a dangerous trend — and its supporters should not pretend that their current plans have anything to do with free-market principles."

    "URL": "https://spectator.org/andrew-yangs-ubi-a-universally-bad-idea/",
    "content": "The road to hell, as we know, is paved with good intentions. And perhaps no one has better intentions, or a faster car, than Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. The Asian entrepreneur’s sense of humor and cheery disposition are a breath of fresh air compared to an otherwise doom-and-gloom Democratic field. But it’s this likability that makes Yang particularly dangerous — for the more agreeable he is, the more naive voters are likely to buy into his version of Universal Basic Income. UBI, as it’s popularly known, is essentially a guaranteed check from the government that citizens are free to use any way they see fit. Yang’s website describes his version thusly: This form of basic income … is a set of guaranteed payments of $1,000 per month, or $12,000 per year, to all U.S. citizens over the age of 18. Yes, that means you and everyone you know would get $1,000/month every month from the U.S. government, no questions asked. The idea of a UBI is gaining traction in the national conversation due to fears that technologies such as artificial intelligence and automation will drastically reduce the number of jobs available to Americans in the coming years. In other words, it’s a policy rooted in fear. Not a new fear, mind you, but one that has always haunted progress, and yet time and time again has been proved unfounded. In fact, the term Luddite, which has come to define broadly those opposed to technology, is rooted in a movement from 1800s England that opposed the use of machinery in the textile industry. A more American version exists in the legend of John Henry, the steel-driving man who dropped dead attempting to prove that he could outdig a machine. And yet today, in the thick of the Information Age bombarded by technology unthinkable just years ago, American unemployment hovers near historic lows. But facts are of little consequence to those being offered something for nothing, and Yang’s appeal is growing among Democrats. He’s gone from a long shot just months ago to fourth place in a recent Emerson poll, even leading Kamala Harris in her home state of California. This success is in no small part due to Yang separating himself from his socialist competitors by touting his economic vision as capitalism, even alluding to the corporate model by branding his version of UBI the Freedom Dividend (because nothing says freedom quite like reliance on a monthly check from the government). It’s a clever linguistic sleight of hand, but Yang’s plan, financed by a value-added tax and increased taxes on the rich (among other things), is just another entitlement stepping stone on our slow march toward socialism. And like all entitlements, it’s terrible policy. Even the most rudimentary examination of Yang’s UBI reveals numerous shortcomings that make it a miserable failure in the long run. For starters, the program will be run by the very same government that has allowed our current entitlement structure to balloon beyond control. Entitlement spending grew from less than 0.5 percent of GDP in 1900 to roughly 19 percent by 2010. In fact, Medicare, Medicaid, and other safety net programs consumed roughly 35 percent of the federal budget in 2017, and along with Social Security promise to bankrupt the country if allowed to continue unabated. The Freedom Dividend will only hasten this demise, and the Yang faithful who insist otherwise are no different than the die-hard leftists who claim the other guys didn’t do it right when discounting socialism’s past failures. But, we are told, UBI will actually save money elsewhere by reducing the bureaucracy that haunts other federal entitlement programs. Not so, as Yang’s Freedom Dividend doesn’t get rid of entitlements altogether. Rather, according to Yang’s website, current welfare and social program beneficiaries would be given a choice between their current benefits or $1,000 cash unconditionally — most would prefer cash with no restriction. Of course they would! The one merit of the current system is that it at least attempts to ensure government assistance goes to families instead of getting squandered on vices such as alcohol and drugs. Under Yang’s plan such oversight would be optional, ensuring that America’s most vulnerable will suffer the most. Besides, $1,000 per month in today’s dollars is very little money. In an age where $100 barely buys a decent dinner in most big cities, it’s mystifying why some think 10 times that amount will rescue America from its inevitable robot overlords. But such logic hasn’t stopped other countries from trying their own UBI experiments. Spoiler alert: they didn’t end well. One of UBI’s central tenets is that it will increase employment because recipients needn’t worry about losing benefits once employed. The results of an experiment in Finland proved this wasn’t the case. A similar experiment in Canada was canceled last year due to its being quite expensive. It’s a good thing too, because should any form of UBI succeed an absurd future is sure to follow. The masses, dependent on their payments, will vote solely on promises to increase them. Entitlements, like taxes, are rarely, if ever, repealed, and once the government starts writing checks to every Tom, Dick, and Harry you can bet the populace will not part with them peacefully. Soon our coffers will be bare and our existence solely dependent on the goodwill of the state, and for what? A measly check that doesn’t even begin to pay a house note most places? Proponents of UBI frequently bite back by citing that conservative pundit royalty, such as Milton Friedman and Charles Murray, have voiced support for the policy, and that even Richard Nixon came dangerously close to advocating for such a system. Nixon and Friedman were human and were deprived of decades of data that show just how poorly entitlements perform in eliminating poverty. Murray is simply misguided, although he is adamant that UBI replace all other forms of assistance, something that, again, Yang’s plan fails to do. It’s easy to see why people like Yang. He’s an enigmatic, interesting figure who largely foregoes the hateful politics of his Democratic colleagues. But that only makes him, and his ideas, exponentially more dangerous."

    "content": "If anyone wonders what effect a Universal Basic Income would have on the economy, one need only order some Buffalo wings. The bill will come with a sticker shock, thanks to the current chicken shortage in the U.S. As the Wall Street Journal reported, the limited supply and subsequent price hike is a result of labor shortages that have been seen across industries since the U.S. economy began reopening. Chicken suppliers are struggling to get enough workers to keep up with demand. And it’s not just those who keep America in tenders and nuggets that are having a hard time finding workers. As Business Insider reported, weekly jobless claims are at a pandemic-era low, but businesses, particularly in the restaurant and service industries, are still struggling to hire. Taco Bell is looking to fill thousands of open roles and is interviewing candidates en masse in parking lots, while McDonald’s has cited a labor shortage in saying that some dining rooms may not reopen this year, Reuters reported earlier this month. Persistent fear of COVID-19 has been cited as one factor keeping people from applying for jobs, but another major disincentive to work are unemployment benefits. At the height of the pandemic last year, when millions of Americans were filing for unemployment, passage of the CARES Act  provided an extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits for those who lost their jobs. It made sense — businesses were shuttered, the economy was cratering, and families struggled to get by. The benefits were extended through the year, and even now, as the economy is reopening and enjoying a growth spurt, President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan includes weekly $300 unemployment benefits through Sept. 6. Businesses are opening their stores, jobs are available, and yet many employers are dangling signing bonus to attract applicants. As the New York Times reported, some experts have argued that these benefits might actually discourage unemployed workers from returning to the labor force. Toby Malara, government affairs counsel at the American Staffing Association, told Insider in February, We began to see that some employees were in a position where they were literally making four, five sometimes $6 an hour more on UI (unemployment insurance) with the pandemic bonus. It did not make sense for them to go back to work. This should be a cautionary tale, an object lesson in unintended consequences. However, with progressives such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang as proponents, the UBI discussion is here to stay. And if enhanced unemployment benefits are helping stoke a paucity of potential employees willing to get back to work, what are the chances a guaranteed income won’t do the same? A Universal Basic Income would provide monthly funds, regardless of circumstances or need. According to Forbes, proponents calculated from government statistics to show that a generous stipend of $3,000 a month for each adult in the country would cut the nation’s poverty rate in half. Processing chicken for $17 an hour hardly makes sense in comparison. The extra $300 in unemployment benefits ends in September. There will, of course, be progressive cries to keep the deal going. Here’s hoping lawmakers are learning from this labor shortage and its causes and resolve to get America back to work."

    "content": "As part of their plan to dramatically expand the cost and scope of the welfare state, President Joe Biden and Congressional Democrats want to flip the tax code on its head and turn the IRS into an agency that provides cash welfare. It will create a universal basic income that will incentivize many Americans not to work and allows the state to further intrude in the lives of everyday Americans. The cornerstone of this plan is to transform the $2,000 child tax credit into a monthly, fully refundable payment of up to $300 per month. Families would qualify for this subsidy regardless of how much they earn and could receive the entire payment as a cash allowance. Democrats also hope to expand the earned income tax credit — providing further cash assistance to Americans — and expand the Obamacare advanced refundable credit so many Americans pay nothing for their healthcare premiums. Democrats have already made some progress toward this goal by implementing these policies on a temporary basis in the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending bill based in March. They know this does not have popular support and that is why they label this welfare spending as a middle-class tax cut. This is a way for the left to permanently expand the size of the federal government. Back in March, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the third-ranking Democrat, remarked the coronavirus pandemic is a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision. Since then, Democrats have enacted myriad welfare programs that will see a family of four with two unemployed persons receiving $109,048 from the federal government between April 2020 and September 2021, according to a report by House Ways and Means Republicans. A family of four with one unemployed person will receive $67,824 from the government, while a family of four with no income loss will receive $26,600. This is a staggering level of cash assistance, especially given the median household income in 2019 was $68,703, according to the Census Bureau. This has resulted in an unprecedented level of federal spending. Yet Democrats want to spend more — extending the child tax credit refundable payments through 2025 alone will cost $450 billion, according to the White House. Not only will these reforms lock in unsustainable federal spending, but refundable tax credits, like the child tax credit, will lead to significant new waste, fraud and abuse. A recent report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found one-third of payments made from the additional child tax credit were improper — meaning the payments should not have been made, were made in the incorrect amount or were paid to an ineligible recipient. The report also estimated a 41% error rate for Obamacare premium tax credit payments and similar rates for other credits. Given this record of failure, it is almost certain the Democrat plan to expand refundable credits to the tune of over 100 billion per year will result in a significant amount of new wasted taxpayer dollars. It is also unclear how much expanding welfare programs through the tax code will help American families. Historically, cash transfer programs that aren’t tied to work reduce employment because there is no incentive to have a job. Less than 40% of the refundable child tax credit will flow to Americans in the lowest quintile of income. This is an effort to drag more of the middle class into welfare dependency. The solution to economic problems should not be more government dependency. Rather, we should promote economic growth and free markets so businesses are hiring, raising wages and keeping costs down. The Democrat plan to transform the tax code into an agency that provides cash payments is alarming. It is the tip of the spear for their effort to permanently expand the size and scope of the federal government and dramatically expand the welfare state."

    "content": "The Democratic Party used to call itself the party of working people and hail the dignity of work. No more. Now Democrats want to guarantee people who choose not to work an income funded by the suckers who do the right thing by showing up for work, caring for their family and paying taxes. Fortunately, these self-supporting Americans just dodged a bullet. The failure to pass Build Back Better in Congress, thanks to holdout Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) means that the monthly checks or automatic bank deposits to parents with kids, sometimes dubbed Biden Bucks, ended last month. For working people, the monthly payments were merely an advance on their tax refunds — but parents who choose not to work have been getting no-strings money to support their nonworking lifestyle. Using the pretext of pandemic relief, Democrats enacting the American Rescue Plan last March changed a feature of the tax code — the child tax credit available to adults who work and pay taxes — into a grant paid unconditionally and monthly to almost all adults with kids, whether they work or not. Democrats have been pushing to extend the monthly payments through 2022 as part of the Build Back Better Act, with a plan to make them permanent. Manchin saw right through what his party intended: a socialist-style universal basic income. Manchin objected to the unconditional monthly cash grants: There’s no work requirement whatsoever. Don’t you think if we’re going to help the children, Manchin asked, the parents should make some effort? So what about the Democratic Party that represents working people? President Joe Biden still talks the talk. My Dad used to say, ‘Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.’  But Biden’s party is no longer walking that walk. As Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wisc.) told the House Ways and Means Committee during a debate over Build Back Better, the so-called dignity of work — that’s like hearing a fingernail on a chalkboard. New York Magazine’s Eric Levitz calls Manchin’s work ethic convictions contemptible. Sorry, but most Americans don’t want to support the moochers. Supporters of the monthly payments hail them as already a huge success for lifting millions of children out of poverty. Nonsense. That’s what a working parent does. The national poverty rate fell temporarily, but the payments didn’t solve the problem of parents without the mindset to support their children. This is deja vu. Before the 1996 welfare reform enacted by a Republican Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton, Uncle Sam used to send checks to nonworking parents. Welfare reform changed that, requiring parents to work or train for work in order to receive cash benefits. It succeeded, reducing the welfare rolls, ameliorating child poverty and helping single mothers become self-sufficient. Yet, today’s Democratic Party spurns that model. Democrats tend to blame unemployment on racism or a rigged economy and argue that people deserve dignity, whether they choose to work or not. Of course, all human beings deserve dignity — but not a seat on the couch in front of the TV funded by people who toil. Democratic politicians all over the nation are pushing to provide a monthly basic income to the nonworking poor, courtesy of taxpayers. They’ve formed Mayors for a Guaranteed Income. Los Angeles is sending out monthly $1,000 checks to 2,000 residents. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is using millions in federal pandemic relief funding to distribute $500 a month cash stipends to randomly chosen low-income recipients. That ought to enrage anyone who works and pays taxes. Jobs are plentiful. The National Federation of Independent Businesses reported that over half of small business owners cannot fill positions. Small businesses are posting Help Wanted signs in windows. Every time you pass one of those signs, you can thank Manchin for holding the line against making taxpayers into suckers supporting the freeloaders."

    "content": "Universal Basic Income may someday come to Massachusetts but if a long-shot bill on Beacon Hill is any indication, we’ll be doing it wrong. UBI is a model to provide every citizen or resident a stable monthly stipend with which to supplement their income, regardless of their work status or any other factor. Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang calls his UBI a \"Freedom Dividend,\" which \"Would enable all Americans to pay their bills, educate themselves, start businesses, be more creative, stay healthy, relocate for work, spend time with their children, take care of loved ones, and have a real stake in the future,\" according to his website. The idea is to give people access to some disposable income even as our economy undergoes major changes. As manufacturing, retail and truck driving jobs are automated away, for instance, those employed in those fields would have enough pocket money to make adjustments. In addition, if UBI were to replace some existing benefits programs, it could potentially cut down on administrative costs and eliminating the bureaucratic middle man. Fewer government salaries? Yes, please. But the bill hatched on Beacon Hill is different. It would test UBI on 100 residents in each of three cities or towns. Everyone chosen for the trial program would receive $1,000 a month for three years and agree to participate in a study. The bill is co-sponsored by state Sen. James B. Eldridge (D-Acton) and Rep. Tami L. Gouveia (D-Acton), and a quick reading of the text gives a pretty good indication of the impetus behind it. House Bill 1632 would require that a report would be filed after one year to, among other things, consider  \"How universal basic income could be used to address historic and contemporary inequalities, including, but not limited to, institutional racism.\" In other words, a social justice program using the taxpayer’s money. This bill is not expected to get anywhere and it shouldn’t. The UBI conversation is an interesting one to have for both conservatives and liberals as our economy changes but it should not be tethered to the progressive cause du jour."

    "content": "Last week marked the 50th anniversary of Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty, and as the joke goes, Poverty won. Five decades after a blizzard of programs began descending on the American people, the poverty rate remains essentially unchanged. That’s a little unfair. What counts as poverty today would not have seemed so impoverished 50 years ago, when many of the poor lived without electricity and were no strangers to hunger. Today, the biggest health problems of the poor are more likely to stem from obesity than anything approaching starvation. Defenders of the war on poverty — and the massive bureaucracy that has built up around it — insist that underfunding is to blame. That’s a tough sell. The Heritage Foundation’s Robert Rector estimates that we’ve spent $20 trillion on these programs — not counting Medicare and Social Security. We spend $1 trillion to $2 trillion more every year, depending on how you do the math. But apparently for liberals, that’s still too stingy. Perhaps the problem isn’t how much we’re spending, but how we’re spending it. If you drew a Venn diagram of where the hard left and the libertarian right agreed, the overlapping shaded part would include a bunch of social issues — gay marriage, drug legalization, etc. — but almost no economic issues. Save one: the Universal Basic Income. The UBI is a pretty simple idea. Everyone gets a check from the government. (Actually, it’s a little more complicated than that depending on how you implement it, but you get the idea.) Charles Murray, my colleague at the American Enterprise Institute and a legendary libertarian social scientist, wrote a wonderful book a few years ago, In Our Hands, in which he proposed an annual grant from the federal government of $10,000 for every American over 21 who stayed out of jail and still had a pulse. He was building on arguments made by two titans of libertarianism, Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, who also supported some version of a UBI.On the left, the idea has been popular for generations as a way to instantaneously alleviate poverty and to defeat the ol’ devil of income inequality. So what’s the catch? Why aren’t we getting a fat check from Uncle Sam every month? Some cite the cost, which obviously would be hefty. But that’s a secondary problem. The real sticking point is that the libertarian argument is largely an either/or proposition, while the left-wing version is a both/and deal. The libertarians want to liquidate much of the welfare state and convert it into cash payments. The left’s version is that the money would, for the most part, augment the welfare state. New York University professor Lawrence Mead identified the chief flaw with both the libertarian and left-wing approaches to fighting poverty, either through existing welfare programs or through a UBI: the competence assumption. This is the presumption that the intended beneficiaries of government anti-poverty programs always behave rationally enough to advance their own self-interest. We all know enough people in our own lives (never mind what we know about ourselves) to realize this isn’t always the case. Lots of folks are determined to do things that aren’t in their long-term self-interest. The problems afflicting many poor people are often of their own making, at least in part. Having children before getting married, dropping out of high school, etc., are transparently bad choices that millions of people make. (Also, some anti-poverty programs create incentives that make bad decisions seem rational.) But many poor people have just had rotten luck. There’s good reason to believe that, with a little help, they can work their way up the economic ladder. And for countless others, the truth probably lies somewhere in between. For 50 years, we’ve run a massive experiment around one approach: that bureaucrats and social planners can fix the lives of others by telling them how to live. For some it’s worked, for others it’s been an abject failure. But few can claim it’s all been a smashing success. Perhaps a compromise can be worked out. Why not give poor people a choice? They can stay within the rat maze of the current welfare state, or they can cash out. According to Rector, 100 million Americans receive aid from the government at an average cost of $9,000 per recipient. Surely some of them are equipped to spend that money better than the government. Why not give them a shot at proving it? If they fail, they can always switch back to the old system. If they succeed, well, that’d be a real victory in the war on poverty."

    "content": "Last week, Newark, N.J., Mayor Ras Baraka announced his intent to pursue a universal basic income program for his city’s residents. He’ll launch a pilot program to test the idea. The idea of giving people a basic income is neither new nor untested. It has figured in conceptions of a utopian state since, well, Thomas More wrote Utopia over 500 years ago. Today, universal basic incomes are espoused by tech titans concerned that future workplaces will replace humans with robots, and by some progressives who wish to prop up people unwilling to work, as the Green New Deal put it.Even some conservative intellectuals, such as Milton Friedman, have proposed variations of a universal basic income to replace the welfare state, most regulation, and labor laws like the minimum wage. But this is unlikely to happen regardless of the merits of such a trade (and there are many). The tech titan claim that robots will soon replace humans is overblown. Technological unemployment is a fear as old as time. Some types of work are always being replaced by new technologies, but that doesn’t mean that the workers themselves are replaced. Rather they are often absorbed into new forms of work. Today’s advocates argue that this time is different. But of course, that same argument has accompanied every fundamental change in the economy. This is not to say that the fear of technological unemployment isn’t real. In 2018, Paul McClure, a professor of sociology at the University of Lynchburg, found that 40 percent of Americans are afraid of automation and the pace of technological change. But history is full of examples of these fears being unfounded. President Franklin Roosevelt’s economic advisers worried that technological advances made during the World War II production effort would eliminate so many jobs that unemployment would skyrocket when the soldiers returned home. No such thing happened. The progressive version of the basic income isn’t rooted in technological unemployment. Rather it’s a mechanism for redistributing money. It’s based on the idea that everyone is entitled to an income, whether they’re willing to work for it or not.For progressives, non-work is a feature of the basic income system, not a bug. They say that, if we were to adopt a basic income, the arts would flourish, entrepreneurship would rise, and workers would have more bargaining power. But the results of basic income experiments are mixed, at best. In Finland, researchers found that a two-year pilot program providing a basic income to 2,000 unemployed people produced no meaningful changes to entrepreneurship. Other studies found some improvements in health and educational outcomes, but the gains realized are small compared to those achieved by more targeted policies. Closer to home, Ontario, Canada pulled the plug on its basic income experiment only 15 months into its scheduled three-year run. The pilot program, restricted to low-income people only, replaced their unemployment, pension and disability benefits with a generous basic income. The government cited excessive costs as the reason for terminating the program early. In America, a basic income program would be a far departure from the safety-net programs now in place. We have compulsory social insurance systems for those who work, and means-tested entitlements intended for people who would work but cannot for whatever reason. In other words, people who can work are expected to pay their own way and those who cannot are covered by welfare. Basic income programs also have a political weak spot that emerges over time. While money for nothing proposals may have broad appeal, in practice these programs tend to provide much larger transfers to childless, healthy adults than current programs do. This is simply not a group that garners a lot of sympathy.The sustainability of any basic income program depends on whether a democratic system could support and afford it over a period of time. And basic income programs are very unstable. Canada and Finland abandoned their experimental programs early because of cost and political concerns. Mayor Baraka may move forward with his experiment. But real-world experience suggests it will be unsuccessful and short-lived."

    "content": "New Jersey’s largest city plans to test whether universal basic income is feasible, making it the latest government to flirt with a program that would guarantee income for residents whether or not they have a job. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka announced his decision last week to create a task force and pilot program to study whether the program is possible.We believe in Universal Basic Income, especially in a time where studies have shown that families that have a crisis of just $400 a month may experience a setback that may be difficult, even impossible to recover from, Baraka reportedly said, adding that one-third of the city still lives in poverty. According to Fox 5 New York, Baraka did not release any further details of the plan, like how it could be funded or when a final decision would be made. While Newark (where 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker used to serve as mayor) is still in the very early stages of examining the program, it has seen little success elsewhere. In 2017, Finland tested the program, giving 560 Euros ($584) to 2,000 unemployed Finnish citizens per month, with no requirement to find a paying job. By 2019, Finland scrapped the program entirely. Last summer, Ontario, Canada, also announced it would end a program that gave money to people in low-paying jobs—instead of welfare benefits—after the government found it was not sustainable and expensive. But U.S. cities are still pushing the concept. Last month, Stockton, Calif. became the first city in the nation to actually press ahead with its program, offering $500 prepaid debit cards to a group of 130 adults who live in the city’s lower-income neighborhood, according to The Sacramento Bee.The mayor of Stockton last year said the program’s purpose is to eventually ensure that no one in Stockton, with a population of 300,000, lives in poverty. The recipients of the cash are able to spend the money on anything they want without any rules or regulations. Also in California, a startup, Y Combinator, based in Oakland, began a basic income test this year, giving $1,500 a month to randomly selected residents. According to The Technology Review, the test will cost the company $60 million, with 75 percent going directly to the participants. The company plans to run the program for between three and five years. Chicago also has weighed the option of introducing the program, which would make it the largest city in the U.S. to get on board. Alderman Ameya Pawar, last summer, proposed the legislation, which would provide 1,000 families with a $500 monthly stipend.Meanwhile, 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang is pushing a plan for universal basic income. The entrepreneur from New York City, as of last month, was personally giving away money to families in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states that vote first and second in the presidential primary contests. It would help people improve their health, nutrition, pay off some debts and bills that have been hanging over them, reduce their stress levels, Yang told Fox News in an interview last month. His proposal would involve the government giving $12,000 a year to each adult American."

    "content": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's now infamous talking points on the Green New Deal are the most unintentionally honest explanation of the neo-socialism now gripping the Democratic Party. Too honest, apparently. After her office sent the FAQ to NPR, The Washington Post and other news organizations, and posted a similar version on her congressional website, they were met with withering criticism -- prompting Ocasio-Cortez to furiously backtrack, seeking to disown and discredit documents her office had produced, posted and distributed. Sorry, you don't get to do that. Ocasio-Cortez told us what is really behind her Green New Deal. Now she, and the Democrats who endorsed her plan, have to live with it. Ocasio-Cortez has been pilloried for her plan to get rid of farting cows and airplanes, upgrade or replace every building in America, replace every combustible-engine vehicle and provide economic security for people unwilling to work -- and rightly so. The old five-year plans of the former Soviet Union are modest, by comparison, in their pursuit of full socialism. Yet the big untold story is her admission that all of this cannot be paid for simply by taxing the rich. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is campaigning for president on a wealth tax, while Ocasio-Cortez has proposed 70 percent marginal tax rates on wealthy Americans. The message is clear: We'll soak the millionaires and billionaires and mega-rich corporations so we can give you free stuff. But her talking points (even the watered-down version that was posted on her website) admit that won't come close to covering the full costs of her Green New Deal. The level of investment required is massive, the talking points declare. Even if every billionaire and company came together and were willing to pour all the resources at their disposal into this investment, the aggregate value of the investments they could make would not be sufficient. Her document says that funding the Green New Deal requires World War II levels of government spending of between 40 and 50 percent of gross domestic product. Today, federal spending amounts to 21 percent of GDP, or $4.4 trillion annually. Increasing it to between 40 and 50 percent of GDP would require doubling government expenditures to between $84 and $105 trillion over 10 years (and that's without factoring in rising GDP). But Warren's wealth tax would raise just $2.75 trillion over 10 years. And according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent marginal rate might raise at best $189 billion over 10 years and could actually cost the federal government $63.5 billion in lost revenue by stifling economic growth and encouraging capital flight. Taxing the rich won't come close to covering the costs of the Green New Deal, which includes a bunch of socialist policies that have nothing to do with climate change. Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl has calculated the 10-year costs using liberal and nonpartisan sources. The results are stunning: $32 trillion for a single-payer health care plan; $6.8 trillion for a government jobs guarantee; $2 trillion for education, medical leave, job training and retirement security; and between $5 trillion and $40 trillion to fund universal basic income to support those who are unwilling to work. (The final price depends on how universal it is.) Grand total? Between $46 and $81 trillion. The only way to raise the revenue for even the low end of that estimate, he calculates, would require establishing a European-style value-added tax of 87 percent on everything we buy, or a new 37 percent payroll tax for every American (on top of the current 15.3 percent payroll tax and all existing federal, state and local taxes.)And that covers the price tag only before we even get to the energy and environmental policies in the Green New Deal. It is virtually impossible to accurately calculate the cost of replacing every vehicle that uses a combustion engine; bringing high-speed rail to every corner of America; upgrading or replacing every building in America; and replacing all fossil fuel energy with alternative energy sources. We're talking hundreds of trillions of dollars. It would be virtually impossible to pay for it. And Americans don't want to anyway. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 56 percent say they support Medicare-for-all, but when they learn it requires more taxes, 60 percent oppose it. With her FAQ, Ocasio-Cortez has inadvertently exposed the neo-socialist lie that you can get something for nothing. The Democratic Party's embrace of that lie is going to get President Trump re-elected"

    "content": "A county in California is helping fund a universal basic income (UBI) program that restricts participation based on race and sex. Officials in Marin County, California, have launched a UBI program in the county designed to give $1,000 a month to 125 qualifying residents for two years in partnership with the Marin Community Foundation. The county is contributing $400,000 to the program, with the remainder of the estimated $3 million coming from the foundation. The program is slightly modeled after a similar one that ran from February 2019 to February 2020 in Stockton, California. The Marin County program, however, has a couple of conditions for residents to receive payments: recipients must be women of color with a child under the age of 18. Chief executive of the Marin Community Foundation Thomas Peters confirmed the restriction to the Marin Independent in an email. This first cohort will focus on low-income moms of color, Peters said. We're starting with those moms with the greatest aggregate of challenges: low income, young children and facing the daily travails and insults of overt and covert racial discrimination. County supervisors unanimously voted to greenlight the project last week. The ultimate endgame for this demonstration project is to have an example of how cash aid can be really helpful in terms of alleviating poverty, to test the usefulness of this approach to addressing poverty and addressing some of the racial inequities that we know exist in the county and beyond, Marin Community Foundation Vice President Jonathan Logan told county supervisers before the vote, according to the Independent. Logan was joined in addressing the board by Marin County Director of Economic Opportunity Barbara Clifton Zarate and the county’s equity officer Anyania Muse. Zarate said the participants in the county program are selected at random from 4,600 people who have received financial aid from the Oakland nonprofit, the Family Independence Initiative (FII). Eligible participants are individuals who earn a living below the area’s self-sufficiency standard as set by a different Oakland nonprofit, the Insight Center for Economic Development, according to Zarate. The program will also provide wrap-around services for participants, including job training and placement programs. The measure saw criticism from a city supervisor, David Connolly, who voted for it but said the program does not apply to his district. When I hear the geographic specificity, I'm hearing my district, District 1, is not included, he said. I know there are many single moms who would otherwise fit the criteria for the need and opportunity presented by this program. When asked by Fox News for comment on the program and whether or not the Marin Community Foundation believed the program was discriminatory, foundation president and CEO Dr. Thomas Peters said that this initial program is directed at women of color who carry a double-weighted burden in their path to self-sufficiency and that the reason to target women of color specifically was not for any reason of exclusion, but because we are laser-focused on an area of greatest need. Our pilot program is the next phase in a research study we conducted last year focused on low-income Moms who are struggling to care for their families and better their educational and economic standing.  No surprise but still quite dismaying, we found that the women who are grappling with the most serious difficulties of all are Moms of color, who face not only financial challenges but the daily imposition of overt and covert discrimination, said Peters. A double-weighted burden in their path to self-sufficiency. So yes, this initial pilot program is directed to them, not for any reasons of exclusion but because we are laser-focused on an area of greatest need. Proudly so. UBI programs have become a hot topic of discussion by progressives after it was popularized by former presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Proponents of UBI say the practice would help alleviate financial stress for people whose jobs are being replaced by automation and those who can’t work. Opponents say that the program would harm the national economy, as well as state and local ones, and devalue the dollar."

    "URL": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/andrew-yang-nyc-mayoral-bid-universal-basic-income",
    "content": "Former 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang on Thursday launched his New York City mayoral campaign -- hoping to replace outgoing Bill de Blasio with an audacious pitch for a universal basic income as a headline policy. I’m running for mayor for a very simple reason -- I see a crisis and believe I can help, he said, citing the COVID crisis as well as high unemployment in the Big Apple. Yang spoke in Morningside Heights on the Upper West Side of Manhattan after announcing his campaign on Wednesday evening. We need bold ideas and fresh ideas to revive our city, he said. We need to look forward and adapt to economic challenges of today and the future. We also need a city government focused on competence and delivering for our people every day. He called on the city to move away from political blame games: When in reality, the people have been losing and it is tearing our city apart. Yang could stake out a relatively moderate candidacy in a field of left-wing Democratic hopefuls. He described his platform as a positive vision for New York City and a rational, progressive plan to implement it and make it a reality. He is widely seen as an early frontrunner and has been surrounded by speculation and interest since he filed paperwork last month. If his bid succeeds, he would replace the left-wing de Blasio, who cannot run for a third team. De Blasio has been dueling with Gov. Andrew Cuomo over the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hizzoner won plaudits from the left for the implementation of the universal pre-K program but has had his 2020 consumed with the battles of the pandemic and getting schools to reopen, as well as increased crime. Yang, 46, was born in Schenectady, New York, and his parents are immigrants from Taiwan. He moved to the Big Apple when he was 21. In the 2020 primary, he touted his background in tech startup and gained a passionate following from supporters who became known as the Yang Gang. His universal basic income proved popular among Democrats, and it caught on with other candidates in the field -- reemerging amid questions of how to stimulate the economy in the COVID-era. He has called for it again in NYC, calling it the largest basic income program in the history of the country. Yang’s policy for New York City would begin by giving those classed as living in extreme poverty about $2,000 a year. This program can then be grown over time as it receives more funding from public and philanthropic organizations, with the vision of eventually ending poverty in New York City altogether, he says on his campaign website. Illegal immigrants would be eligible for the program, while it would not replace current forms of welfare. He has separately proposed a People’s Bank of New York City. He is likely to face a packed roster of Democratic challengers ahead of the June Democratic primary. Other early mayoral candidates include New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams. Whoever wins the primary will likely be the favorite against any Republican challenger in the overwhelmingly Democratic city. Yang took hits from primary rivals after he told The New York Times that he had decided to relocate because of cramped conditions in his two-bedroom apartment. Detractors pointed out that New York City residents have contended with the same scenario for months, often in apartments smaller than his. But Yang brushed off the criticism. Every New York parent has struggled with educating our children in a time of COVID. I’ve been proud to live, work and raise my kids in this city for 25 years, Yang said in response to the criticism. After COVID shut down our public schools, we took our two kids, including my autistic son, to upstate New York to help him adapt to our new normal. On the pandemic, he is prioritizing a push for New York City to reopen, noting the damage the lockdowns have done to the economy. He has called for reopening schools and businesses but has also emphasized reopening the fun side of the city. New York City needs to be the first major City to reopen, and that means reopening everything that makes us who we are, he says on his campaign website. Our restaurants, our playhouses, our parks, our events - we’ve sacrificed for the common good, and we deserve to make New York City fun again. He’s also called for the biggest post-COVID celebration in the world and for to-go cocktails to be made a permanent fixture -- noting their popularity in lockdown New York -- as well as legalization of marijuana."

    "content": "A Canadian province has ditched a universal basic income welfare program after the government found it was not sustainable, making it the latest around the globe to scrap the plan. The move comes as several American cities flirt with bringing the scheme to the U.S. Ontario’s new conservative government this week said it would end the pilot program, which gave free government funds to people in low-paying jobs -- instead of welfare benefits -- in the region to test whether the money helped to improve health, education and housing. The government reportedly called the plan expensive and not sustainable. Lisa MacLeod, the Ontario minister for social services told The Guardian that the program was clearly not the answer for Ontario families. Ontario’s decision comes on the heels of Finland’s decision to scrap its own test of universal basic income. Finland’s program gave 560 Euros ($584) to 2,000 unemployed Finnish citizens per month, with no requirement to find a paying job. Earlier this year however, Finland decided not to extend the funding to the program. Even as Canadian and European plans failed, U.S. cities are still pushing to test the scheme. Stockton, Calif. Is set to become the first in the U.S. to take on the experiment, with a plan to pay 100 residents $500 a month without any conditions. The program’s purpose is to eventually ensure that no one in Stockton, with a population of 300,000, lives in poverty. The receivers of the cash will be able to spend the money on anything they want without any rules or regulations. Stockton’s plan is slated to launch by 2019, and the tested resident pool will receive the funds for a full 18 months as a trial phase before being rolled out across the city. Also in California, a startup, Y Combinator, based in Oakland, is giving out $1,500 a month to randomly selected residents. Chicago is also weighing up the option of introducing the program, which would make it the largest city in the U.S. to get on board. Alderman Ameya Pawar recently proposed the legislation, which would provide 1,000 families with a $500 monthly stipend — no questions asked. Pawar’s bill already has the backing of the majority of city lawmakers, and Pawar hopes to soon work with Mayor Rahm Emanuel to implement the pilot program, The Intercept reported. Nearly 70 percent of Americans don’t have $1,000 in the bank for an emergency, Pawar told the outlet. UBI could be an incredible benefit for people who are working and are having a tough time making ends meet or putting food on the table at the end of the month. A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that 60 percent of Americans favor the government providing a guaranteed income that would allow them to meet their basic needs, as workers with a high school diploma were the most likely to support a universal basic income at 65 percent, and workers with a four-year college education or more at 52 percent."

    "content": "A study into universal basic income in Finland found that while the left-wing solution raised happiness levels, it didn’t boost the job market and was found to be unsustainable -- just as the radical idea has picked up steam in the U.S. amid the coronavirus crisis. Finland in 2017 and 2018 gave a monthly check of $685 to its unemployed between ages 25 and 58. It was considered a pilot program -- serving 2,000 randomly selected jobless people -- that its founders hoped to expand. But it was shut down at the end of 2018, amid complaints by critics that it would require an additional 30 percent in taxes on top of what Finns already pay in taxes. According to Bloomberg News, the study found that giving people free money improved their mental well-being as it made them feel more secure about their finances. But Karl Hamalainene, chief researcher at the VATT Institute for Economic Research, said a universal basic income would be expensive and, based on the results of the study, unsustainable. This was a big carrot, and we can see it didn’t fully work, he said. The study also didn’t see a significant boost to the job market by implementing the program, with participants finding work roughly in line with the control group, according to Bloomberg. The study is a dent in the hopes of a number of left-wing Democrats who are increasingly seeing universal basic income as one of a number of solutions to solve inequality and poverty, and more recently to help sustain struggling Americans through the coronavirus pandemic. With the Trump administration sending out $1,200 stimulus checks to most Americans as a one-off payment, some have seen that as a possible starting point to make those payments bigger and more frequent. The idea has been promoted by a host of Democrats, including former 2020 candidates Andrew Yang and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., as well as House Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. It has even caught the eye of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who said recently the idea could be worthy of attention. Let’s see what works, what is operational, and what needs other attention? Others have suggested a minimum income, a guaranteed income for people. Is that worthy of attention now? Perhaps so, she said on MSNBC."

Host Dagen McDowell added that universal basic income could not be an idea at a worse time when employers are struggling to hire workers who see Congress' now-extended pandemic unemployment and stimulus payment benefits as more lucrative than a 9-5 job. There is a worker shortage in part because of the stimulus checks that have been sent out in the last year and the extra unemployment benefits that are still being paid and you see it far and wide, she said. One restaurant I heard about was offering 1,000 bucks if workers stayed on the job for 90 days. So it creates an incentive at the local level for people not to go out — there are almost 7.5 million job openings. That’s higher than before the pandemic even started, she added. Allow me to quote Dana Perino: There is honor and dignity in work. Watters added that UBI will also increase the already exponential rate of illegal immigration, as those folks will take jobs Americans will refuse to. The oft-unseen consequence, he added, is that that money the illegal immigrants make does not always return to the U.S. economy, and is instead sent back to other countries where their families reside. They will just pour across the border and they will start taking those jobs and not paying taxes and then wire the money back home, he said. Host Juan Williams disagreed with the sentiments, saying they were laughable. Now all of a sudden illegal immigrants are voting. I don’t know what to make of this. To my mind this is — I think you said people are just going to cross the border to get this benefit and they are going to vote. I just think it’s nuts, he said. Williams added that conservative and libertarian figures had touted similar policy proposals in the past, pointing to Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, economist Milton Friedman and President Richard Nixon. [Universal basic income] is not for everyone but for very poor people or pregnant women trying to keep them from going into sort of catastrophic straits. That’s what this is about, he sad. I don’t know why you want to paint this as some giveaway to bums."

    "content": "One of the most controversial ideas in political circles today is a Universal Basic Income (UBI). If Newark, New Jersey Mayor Ras Baraka has his way, his state will be at the center of the debate. Baraka announced last week that Newark will soon launch a pilot program to study the impact of a UBI on the city’s poverty rate. Unfortunately, he provided few details for his plan, making it difficult to evaluate. The idea of a UBI has drawn increasing interest from both the left and right as either a replacement or supplement for our existing welfare system. It calls for everyone to receive a cash grant from the government without any strings attached. The same check would be available to rich and poor, working or not. This idea is not as crazy as it initially sounds. The one thing experts from across the political spectrum agree on is that our current welfare system fails to help people escape poverty, become self-sufficient and flourish as full participants in society. Federal, state and local governments spend roughly $1 trillion every year on anti-poverty programs, yet cities like Newark are not thriving. Maybe it’s time to consider a different approach. A UBI has several things to recommend it over traditional welfare. First, a UBI would be far simpler and more transparent than the current hodgepodge of more than 100 existing federal and state programs. With overlapping and often contradictory eligibility levels, work requirements and other restrictions, our existing welfare system is a nightmare of unaccountability. Second, a UBI is far less paternalistic than traditional welfare, which often treats the poor like 10-year-olds receiving an allowance. Rather than provide them with cash – which is what poor people actually need – we dole out a variety of specialized benefits, such as food, housing and health care. Government decides how the poor should budget and spend their money – not the poor themselves. Perhaps most importantly, our current welfare system gets the incentives wrong. For example, it discourages work and marriage. The nation’s highest marginal tax rates are not on the wealthy, but on a poor person who leaves welfare for work. The loss of benefits, combined with taxes and the cost of employment, can leave some people worse off financially if they take a job. A UBI could solve many of those problems. That’s why some version of the idea has drawn interest from diverse ideological bedfellows, including American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. Booker is one of the candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. But there are many important questions to be answered before a UBI should be thought of as a legitimate policy option. That’s why scholars are intently watching experiments that have been taking place around the world. Newark, however, is unlikely to tell us much. Newark is almost certainly not going to provide the city’s residents with a true UBI. The city’s population tops 285,000. If every adult were to receive a UBI of $12,000 per year (as proposed by Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang), and children received half that amount, it would cost nearly $2.5 billion. The taxes necessary to fund such a program would crush any hope for Newark’s economic revitalization. And as businesses and wealthier residents fled the city in droves, the program's funding would collapse. You can’t redistribute wealth that doesn’t exist. More likely, Newark will end up following the lead of other cities like Stockton and Oakland in California that simply offer cash payments of a few hundred dollars to a small number of randomly chosen low-income individuals. That would amount to little more than continuing our current approach to fighting poverty of throwing a little money at the problem. Far from revolutionary, this is just more of the same, and is unlikely to tell us much about whether a UBI would or would not work better than what we do now. This will be compounded by the fact that Mayor Baraka’s plan will also certainly be simply layered on top of existing benefits. The mayor isn’t talking about redesigning or reforming welfare. He simply wants to increase it."

    "author": "John F. Cogan , Daniel L. Heil",
    "URL": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/los-angeles-basic-income-program-welfare-cogan-heil",
    "content": "The city of Los Angeles has begun accepting applications for its misguided Basic Income Guaranteed program. The program promises $1,000 per month to 3,000 poor families. The cash payments come with no restrictions on how the money can be spent and no requirements that participants be employed or seek employment. The belief that this program will help the poor runs counter to centuries of experience with welfare. It ignores our common sense understanding of incentives, and is rejected by a rich body of academic work. The no-strings-attached promise is a sharp departure from centuries of welfare policy. Down through the ages, a hallmark of successful welfare policy has been that recipients must undertake efforts to improve their situation in life in return for aid. Charities, mutual aid societies, religious organizations, and, until recently, all levels of U.S. government have embraced this policy. The policy recognizes that welfare assistance given without responsibility discourages personal initiative for achieving self-sufficiency through work and a better life through family formation. The L.A. program rejects this age-old wisdom in favor of a new belief that unconditional aid does not dampen the natural human desire for self-reliance and self-improvement. This defies common sense. Individuals receiving no-strings-attached aid have fewer reasons to provide for themselves by being employed, looking for employment, or improving their skills. The degree to which these incentives impact behavior may vary from one person to another, but they operate on all persons, including those with a strong commitment to self-reliance. To see the effects of free cash, one only must look at the large number of unfilled job openings and current shortages of basic goods in our local stores. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, both federal and California state governments have flooded the economy with trillions of dollars in unrestricted aid. This is one key reason why millions of abled-bodied Americans are choosing to forego work. Nationwide there are 3.1 million fewer workers in the labor force than there were in September 2019. With fewer workers producing and distributing goods and services, shortages or higher prices are inevitable. Academic research provides more evidence of the dangers of no-strings-attached aid. In the 1960s and 1970s, government-sponsored social experiments tested for the consequences of basic guaranteed income programs on work effort. The results of the experiments, particularly the Seattle-Denver Experiment, were devastating. Despite the fact that participants knew that the experiment was temporary, work effort among participants declined significantly. Largely because of these findings, Congress rejected President Jimmy Carter’s proposed national income guarantee program. More recent academic research on the effects of assistance programs has bolstered these findings. This research has shown that even temporary exits from the workforce have long-term adverse effects on future earnings and employment prospects. So, for the 3,000 families enrolled in the L.A. program, the long-term effects of the short-term cash payments could be very harmful. Economics aside, the program’s supporters wrongly presume that it doesn’t matter whether individuals achieve a level of material well-being through their own efforts, or from government handouts. This belief ignores a crucial facet of living a fulfilled life: efforts and sacrifices to achieve a personal goal are essential to a person’s sense of self-worth. Striving to reach a personal goal, more than achieving a level of material well-being, provides life’s true rewards. The L.A. program’s failure to understand this key aspect of human nature is perhaps its most significant shortcoming. The program’s supporters may say that it is only a pilot program, but this ignores the tendency of small pilot programs to grow into large entitlements. One example is the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Formerly known as Food Stamps, this program began in 1962 as a pilot program. It has since  become a permanent entitlement that now provides monthly assistance to 40 million people. Everyone should care about the plight of the poor. But a no-strings-attached government handout is not the way to help them. More than a century ago, the social reformer H.L. Wayland wrote that to truly help the poor society needs to understand that It is not bread they (the poor) want, it is soul; it is not soup (they need), it is spirit. L.A. city officials would be wise to follow Mr. Wayland’s advice instead of trying to solve the poverty problem by simply throwing more money at it."

    "content": "The city of Stockton, Calif., which launched a universal basic income pilot program earlier this year, will listen to stories from a select group of recipients of the no-strings-attached cash by the end of April, adding tangible anecdotes to the national political conversation on income inequality ahead of 2020. The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, a pilot program on universal basic income, launched in February, the Los Angeles Times reported.  Over 100 residents from the city’s lower-income neighborhoods will be administered $500 a month via debit cards for the next year and a half. The money comes without any restrictions, such as requiring recipients to be employed or maintain sobriety. Head of Stockton’s program, Sukhi Samra, told the Los Angeles Times that 25 participants dubbed storytellers will offer their experiences on how the extra monthly cash has contributed to their lives. While data from the program’s research findings won’t be available until 2021, Samra expects anecdotes to resonate more with voters who could hear the potential effects of their political decisions. Stockton became the first to move ahead on a universal income pilot, as other U.S. cities, including Newark, NJ and Chicago, consider similar programs that would deal out monthly payments to struggling residents. Programs in Canada and Finland were scrapped for being unstainable. Stockton received $1 million in initial funding for the $3.1 million program from the Silicon-Valley-based organization The Economic Security Project. Further research should reveal how basic income programs could be sustained by local or federal governments on a more permanent basic."

    "URL": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-new-york-reparations-universal-basic-income",
    "content": "Race-based universal basic income payments are starting to gain steam in the U.S. as a form of reparation. Last week, Marin County in California approved payments of $1,000 a month to 125 qualifying residents for two years in partnership with the Marin Community Foundation. In New York, Rochester's mayor has also suggested leveraging revenues from marijuana legalization to pay reparations to Black and Brown residents. Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren on Thursday sent a letter to a Latino-focused nonprofit requesting it to join her administration on an exploratory committee to look into the issue. Warren suggested utilizing a universal basic income (UBI) or home ownership program for assisting certain communities. Beyond changing policies and procedures, we must do more to close the wealth gap between Black and Brown people and our White residents, Warren said in the letter to the Ibero-American Action League. With marijuana legalization on the horizon in New York, we have an opportunity we never had before to bring real resources to bear to uplift our families and improve, not just their financial wellbeing, but their very future. Marin County is contributing $400,000 to its program, with the remainder of the estimated $3 million coming from the Marin Community Foundation. The program is slightly modeled after a similar one that ran from February 2019 to February 2020 in Stockton, California. The Marin County program, however, has a couple of conditions for residents to receive payments: recipients must be women of color and have a child under the age of 18. When asked by Fox News for comment on the program and whether or not the Marin Community Foundation believed the program was discriminatory, foundation president and CEO Thomas Peters said that this initial program is directed at women of color who carry a double-weighted burden in their path to self-sufficiency. He also said the reason to target women of color specifically was not for any reason of exclusion, but because we are laser-focused on an area of greatest need. Our pilot program is the next phase in a research study we conducted last year focused on low-income Moms who are struggling to care for their families and better their educational and economic standing.  No surprise but still quite dismaying, we found that the women who are grappling with the most serious difficulties of all are Moms of color, who face not only financial challenges but the daily imposition of overt and covert discrimination, said Peters. Warren's letter comes after last week's report by the Commission on Racial and Structural Equity, which argued that racism is deeply embedded in the culture and practices of Rochester and Monroe County. The report acknowledged that it found hardly any laws in the city and county which created and sustained racist policies. However, the commission added they had found practices and conditions where diversity of race, ethnicity and gender are nearly non-existent; where people of color are unable to fully participate and are implicitly or explicitly excluded from opportunities that could enhance their economic, social and mental health; and where people of color are denied the opportunity to participate in the rule-making and decision-making that shapes our lives, from birth to death.According to Warren's letter, the exploratory committee would review UBI and reparation pilot programs in other cities. It specifically mentions Evanston, Illinois, and Oakland, California, both of which are pursuing monetary assistance for Black families. In Oakland, the payments consist of $500 in monthly payments for 18 months to 600 families who are Black, indigenous, or people of color."

    "content": "Chicago may soon become the largest municipality in the U.S. to test a universal basic income program. Chicago alderman Ameya Pawar recently proposed legislation that would provide 1,000 families with a $500 monthly stipend -- no questions asked. The bill already has the backing of the majority of city lawmakers, and Pawar hopes to soon work with Mayor Rahm Emanuel to implement the pilot program, The Intercept reported. Nearly 70 percent of Americans don’t have $1,000 in the bank for an emergency, Pawar told the outlet. UBI could be an incredible benefit for people who are working and are having a tough time making ends meet or putting food on the table at the end of the month. Pawar campaigned to earn a slot on the ballot for Illinois governor, but withdrew his name from contention after being outspent by his opponents, the outlet reported. In addition to the $500, the bill would adjust the Earned Income Tax Credit program to allow the families to put their tax credit toward their monthly mortgage payment, according to the outlet. Pawar cited automation, with companies such as Amazon, Tesla and other car manufacturers investing in the technology as having the potential to disrupt millions of jobs, that in turn would lead to more political destabilization, according to the outlet. Chicago wouldn't be the only city testing the waters to give residents free money. Stockton, California has also proposed a universal basic income program with the backing of wealthy Silicon Valley moguls that will pay 100 residents $500 a month without any conditions. The program’s purpose is to eventually ensure that no one in Stockton, with a population of 300,000, lives in poverty. The program, which allows the 100 lucky residents to use the money for anything they want, will launch in 2019 and last 18 months before officials decide whether to roll out the program citywide. Alaska has issued every resident of the state a check since 1976 as part of the Alaska Permanent Fund, which is tied to oil revenue and varies on amount, but last year equaled $1,100, according to The Intercept. Countries overseas have also utilized some sort of cash transfer system, with Finland recently putting an end to a program that gave 2,000 unemployed working-age people 560 Euros per month. Tech titans have chimed in their support for a universal basic income, with Tesla founder Elon Musk tweeting last month it will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during a Harvard commencement speech last year that We should explore ideas like universal basic income to make sure that everyone has a cushion to try new ideas. Business magnate Richard Branson has also called for universal basic income. A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that 60 percent of Americans favor the government providing a guaranteed income that would allow them to meet their basic needs, as workers with a high school diploma were the most likely to support a universal basic income at 65 percent, and workers with a four-year college education or more at 52 percent."

    "content": "Mayor Ras Baraka announced last week a plan to test the feasibility of a universal basic income (UBI) for residents of Newark, New Jersey. In making this announcement, Mayor Baraka noted that  one-third of the city still lives in poverty. Poverty in Newark, as in many urban areas, is excessive. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 28.3 percent of Newark’s residents live in poverty versus 10 percent for New Jersey overall. The programs in place to help the poor – such as Section 8 public housing, Medicaid, and SNAP benefits (food stamps) – are often difficult to navigate and unduly expensive. Our welfare system is in dire need of reforms, but such reforms must come at the federal or state levels as mayors have limited ability to implement needed reforms. Mayor Baraka’s desire to independently explore alternatives is understandable but, is UBI really the best or even a workable solution? Mayor Baraka provided no details about a possible UBI initiative. But as the adjective universal implies, such programs generally apply to everyone. This would include those who are unable to work, those who are able to work but choose not to, and those who are working but unable to find a good paying job.  Unfortunately, as with most one size fits all solutions, UBI sounds good but fits poorly. We all feel compassion and a desire to help those who are unable to work or care for themselves and their families. However, previous experiments with UBI have proven ineffective at lifting such individuals out of poverty. Ontario, Canada implemented a three-year UBI. It only covered individuals with low incomes and the benefits replaced unemployment insurance, the state pension and disability payments. The city canceled it after 15 months citing high costs. Here in the U.S., even with significant reforms to existing welfare programs, it is difficult to see how any government entity could sustainably finance a UBI that would actually lift people out of poverty. Costs certainly would be a problem for cities such as Newark that have faced and still face serious financial challenges. A program that is all but preordained to fail won’t help anyone. There is perhaps less compassion for those who are able but choose not to work. Very few people working to support themselves and their families want to additionally support people who could work but would rather not. Finland had a UBI program considered cutting edge at the time. The number of Finns who supported the program dropped from 70 percent to 35 percent when they were told it would increase their taxes. They terminated their UBI program, replacing it with a program that encourages work. Laziness is not a virtue people generally want to underwrite. Well intended welfare programs can also create situations where not working pays better than taking an entry-level job. Intended as a safety net, such programs may become barriers to upward mobility by discouraging people who might otherwise chose to work from entering the labor force. The only way to get on the ladder of opportunity is to get a job. The independence, self-respect and the dignity that come with doing a job well and being rewarded for it are attributes any welfare program should encourage, not discourage. It’s difficult to see how a UBI could avoid this pitfall. Even our current welfare system can punish people who work because, as a person’s income from work reaches the cutoff point for benefits, a slight increase in income may result in a severe decrease in those benefits. Policy wonks call this the welfare cliff. As a result, the system can compel benefit recipients to forgo wage increases or promotions, trading opportunity for safety and preventing them from realizing the independence and self-reliance that come with personal success and a job. This isn’t a criticism. Such individuals are simply making economically rational decisions. For individuals who are working and receiving benefits, a municipal level UBI could similarly lift such individuals’ incomes above the cutoff levels reducing benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Fortunately, there is an existing and proven solution that lifts people out of poverty while allowing them to work and improve their lives. It’s known as the earned income tax credit (EITC). Eligible EITC recipients receive government assistance to supplement their wages. As their income from work rises, their government assistance declines until it is no longer needed. However, the decline is never so steep that it reduces their total income. The more you work, the more you make. According to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the federal EITC lifted about 5.8 million people out of poverty in 2016, including about 3 million children and reduced the severity of poverty for another 18.7 million people, including 6.9 million children.  A growing body of research ties the EITC  to improvements in infant health, school performance, college enrollment, and potential earnings in adulthood, thus reducing poverty both in the near and long term. States have enacted their own EITCs to supplement the federal benefits. While Mayor Baraka’s heart is in the right place, perhaps a better approach would be for Newark to become the first major city to enact its own EITC supplement as the means to both encourage work and reduce poverty."

    "URL": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/andrew-yang-universal-basic-income-welfare-steve-levy",
    "content": "Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang set himself apart from the primary field by proposing what many consider a radical idea, a Universal Basic Income (UBI) of $1,000 per month to be paid by the government to every citizen. Conservatives hate it. Liberals love it. But there is a way that such a government grant could make sense for those on both sides of the political spectrum. UBI could work if it were simultaneously coupled with the near elimination of the present welfare system. OK, so you want a minimum income given to you via a government check. But here’s the deal. No more bogus disability claims; no more year after year food stamps; no more Obama phones, or most other supplemental benefits. Many forget that the idea was first floated by a Republican, President Richard Nixon, in his first term. It got little traction and for good reason. There was no linkage to eliminating a welfare program that was exploding at the time. A far more conservative context was laid out by author Peter Cove in his book Poor No More. Cove was a one-time liberal who was part of the welfare establishment. Over time, he soured on the giveaway bureaucracy that he felt was stifling the potential of lower-class individuals to rise up the economic ladder. He eventually worked with President Bill Clinton on welfare reform. I propose we eliminate all welfare programs, suggested Cove. From 1964 until today we have spent over $19 trillion on such programs and have hardly moved the poverty rate down from 17 percent in 1964 to 14.5 percent in 2014. We should wipe the slate clean, take all the money saved and create jobs. At first blush, it might make hard-working folks recoil that anyone sitting on his duff would get a check. But isn’t it the complaint of many conservatives that this is what’s happening now, anyway? Nothing provides a stronger incentive than a Don’t work, don’t eat policy. That’s not what we have in America today. Clinton’s workfare reforms have been watered down considerably. The present policy says if you don’t work, you can still get a check for food, but if you supplement that check with earnings, you will lose part, or all, of that free stuff. The difference is the new system that guarantees income but eliminates welfare would no longer discourage recipients to earn an extra buck on the fear that it would wipe out their Medicaid, food stamps and other social service benefits. Once you get your minimum salary, anything you make above that is all gravy. It’s still cheaper for the U.S. taxpayer because the mammoth welfare bureaucracy will be a thing of the past. Some will still stay on their couches while they collect the check. But most will be incentivized to get work, full- or part-time. This can only add productivity to the workforce. Moreover, this plan could possibly keep families together, rather than tearing them apart. Ironically, it was the policies of white liberals that precipitated the disintegration of the African American two-parent family through the bizarre incentives do-gooder politicians incorporated into the welfare system. Have more children, get more money. Live apart from your spouse, get more money. Think about how many more children might have fathers back in their lives because there will no longer be a monetary incentive to live apart. For 50 years the Democratic Party has had a lock on the African-American vote. They’ve done so primarily by demonizing white Republicans as being racist toward African-Americans. They’ve also monopolized votes by promising free stuff. The catch is that it has relegated generations to be stuck in poverty since earning over a certain amount of money causes you to lose your benefits. This was borne out in an anecdotal situation told to me by a friend who runs a company on Long Island. The company hired a young lady off of welfare. She performed well and was offered a raise, after which the company received a phone call from the employee’s social worker, demanding it be rescinded. When the flabbergasted company agent asked why, she responded that the employee would lose much of her government-provided assistance. Rejecting the raise preserved that young woman’s present benefits, but it was it a death knell for her dreams of upward mobility. She would forever be stuck in a low-wage dead-end, while maintaining her dependence on government, and, more particularly, the Democratic Party. Little does Yang realize, but his idea may one day be the way poor people can break free of the Democratic Party’s stranglehold that has eviscerated hope for economic advancement. Standing alone, Yang‘s proposal may seem nuts. But if we were to tie it to the near elimination of the welfare system, it could be a godsend for the nation's economy and for those who have been trapped in a cycle of poverty for generations. This idea deserves more thought."

    "content": "Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., on Wednesday said she will be introducing a universal basic income (UBI) program this Congress. She said the plan will get money in people’s pockets in a Wednesday tweet reflective of comments President Biden made when he proposed an increase in weekly unemployment benefits for out-of-work Americans in January during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is long overdue, the Minnesota congresswoman and Squad member said in the Wednesday tweet responding to an article from the Star Tribune about Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey's plan to give about 200 low-income families $500 a month over two years using excess American Rescue Plan funds. Next step: Implementing UBI nationwide, Omar tweeted. This Congress, I’ll be introducing a UBI pilot program to get money in people’s pockets. The COVID-19 pandemic forced Americans to think about the upsides and downsides of UBI. The Trump administration was first to issue direct $1,200 stimulus payments to individuals in the spring of 2020 as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act relief bill. The administration then issued $600 stimulus checks in the winter of 2020 when he signed a second $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill. President Biden then distributed $1,400 stimulus checks in March as part of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Frey told the Star-Tribune that he was inspired by a similar UBI plan St. Paul, which started to give 150 families $500 per month last October. More than 50 mayors across the U.S. are part of a pro-UBI coalition called Mayors for Guaranteed Income (MGI), though Frey is not one of those listed on its website. Proponents of UBI say it helps combat economic instability by providing individuals and families with money to buy necessities like food and pay costs like monthly rent. Other Squad members including Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan have voiced support for UBI. Tlaib introduced the Lift+ (Plus) Act in May of 2019, similar to then-California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris' 2018 Lift Act, to give low-income U.S. families as much as $3,000 per year. $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 — that can really transform their lives, Tlaib told The Washington Post in an interview. I just want more people covered. Opponents of UBI have concerns that direct checks from the government may act as an incentive for people to not find full-time work. Business owners, for example, had blamed a shortage of available workers combined with plenty of available U.S. jobs on federal weekly unemployment benefits, which some states ended early in an effort to boost employment numbers. The Labor Department's May jobs report revealed that employers added 559,000 jobs last month, missing Wall Street's expectations for a gain of about 650,000. It marked the second consecutive miss for job creation: In April, the economy added a revised 278,000 jobs, much smaller than the 1 million forecast by Refinitiv economists. There remain 7.6 million fewer jobs than in February 2020, before the pandemic began. Other opponents argue that UBI would lead to a tax increase on wealthy individuals and corporations, which could cause a spike in consumer prices, a reduction in spending on skills training and higher housing costs."

    "content": "The Windy City may soon experiment with giving its citizens cash windfalls via a universal basic income pilot program. Chicago alderman Ameya Pawar appears to be well on his way to convincing colleagues to test his UBI program for 1,000 families. His goal is to transfer $500 each month in stipends — without conditions — to citizens. Nearly 70 percent of Americans don’t have $1,000 in the bank for an emergency, Mr. Pawar told The Intercept for an interview published Monday. UBI could be an incredible benefit for people who are working and are having a tough time making ends meet or putting food on the table at the end of the month. … It’s time to start thinking about direct cash transfers to people so that they can start making plans about how they’re going to get by. Mr. Pawar’s bill would also implement a process known as smoothing for families taking part in the Earned Income Tax Credit program; they would be paid monthly instead of annually. Our hope, that I know will be born out in this pilot, is that it will show that when we smooth out the EITC, and we provide a monthly basic income to 1,000 families, that they will be able to plan for expenses, they can make decisions about savings, they can make decisions about investing, they could make decisions about how they could deal with a financial emergency, just like all families do, Mr. Pawar said. And once implemented, we’ll be able to hopefully scale it. Not mentioned by the official was how the debt-ridden city would pay for an expansion of such a program. Chief Financial Officer Carole Brown said the city’s total pension debt now stands at $28 billion, down from $31 billion a year ago, thanks to the state legislation, the Chicago Sun-Times reported July 11. Under repeated questioning, Brown refused to say how [Chicago Mayor Rahm] Emanuel — if he is re-elected, that is — would meet the city’s pension obligation when the five-year ramp to actuarial funding is over."

    "content": "Last week the government of Ontario, Canada, announced it was ending a pilot program to guarantee residents a universal basic income (UBI). The program, scheduled to run three years, had lasted just 15 months. The concept of UBI is pretty simple. The government gives everyone money, with no strings attached. How much money? Enough to be meaningful, but not enough to discourage work. The Ontario experiment was a particularly generous version of a UBI. Eligible individuals could receive $17,000 (Canadian; about 13,000 U.S. dollars today) minus half of any earned income. A couple could receive $24,000. And people with disabilities could get as much as $23,000.  For the Ontario pilot, only low-income folks participated, and their benefits replaced unemployment insurance, the state pension and disability payments. The government cited the program’s high cost when announcing the termination. This shouldn’t be a surprise. A similar program in the United States with a 50 percent marginal tax on earned income would cost about $250 billion per year if operating nationwide (assuming no adverse consequences of taxation). Get rid of the tax, and it would cost just shy of $1 trillion per year. There are some benefits to a basic income, especially when used to replace the current welfare system. For instance, a UBI leaves recipients free to decide how to spend their benefits. Many existing welfare programs use incentives, nudges, and other requirements to micromanage how the poor use their benefits. The assumption is that poor people lack certain virtues or fall victim to vices to which the rest of us are immune, and the expert managers of the welfare system know better. I’m with the economist Lionel Robbins, who called this assumption, as applied to political calculations, morally revolting. However, a UBI also entails significant costs beyond the potential increase in federal spending. For example, a UBI might create a mindset that income is rightly derived from someone else’s productivity. This would likely result in people using the political process to vote themselves higher incomes rather than work to improve their own standard of living by creating a better world for others to live. The current welfare state builds on a mindset of generosity. There’s significant value in retaining the connection between welfare and generosity rather than generating a new notion of entitlement. However, one strength of the American system is that, through the freedom of association, we have the ability to test different ideas for generosity against one another. One way to think about accomplishing such a market for generosity is by having more welfare benefits locally administered through private institutions. This might involve some form of cash payments, but a UBI isn’t the way to go. A UBI-focused welfare state is based on the assumption that generosity is just about giving people cash. Or at least giving out cash in a way that will make its tech-titan proponents feel better about making money themselves. However, the world is much more complex than policies of redistribution make it out to be. Through all of the discussion over the UBI, it’s important to remember that one of the best things we can do to improve outcomes for disadvantaged folks is by stopping institutions, and in particular the government, from getting in the way of people recognizing their potential. We can reform occupational licensing laws. We can promote policy that makes sure everyone has access to a good education. We can celebrate ordinary people who get wealthy by providing other ordinary people with exceptional things that existed only in science fiction novels a century ago. And we can do all of this by promoting civility and sympathy for one another. It’s impossible to improve other people’s lives — much less get rich in the process — unless you can first put yourself in their shoes."

    "content": "A minimum income for everyone above a certain age, often called a basic income, is back in vogue. Several major magazines and prominent thinkers from different philosophical backgrounds say a basic income is necessary in an age where robots will replace all jobs. Others call for a basic income to replace the current welfare system. The idea of a minimum income isn’t new. Even the term minimum income is found somewhat regularly in publications dating to the late 19th century. The terms basic income and universal basic income are only the more recent branding of this old idea. The politics of a minimum income (universal or means-tested) also isn’t new. Towards the end of 18th century and into the early 19th century, wheat prices fell, which hit rural areas in Britain particularly hard. The country was also entering a particularly turbulent period of the Industrial Revolution and undergoing unprecedented changes. The nature of work was drastically changing, economic growth wasn’t equally distributed, and real wages for many workers wouldn’t begin rising until later in the century. It was during this time that a number of parishes (local governments) adopted a means-tested minimum income under the old Poor Laws system. It came under fire by utilitarians in the Royal Commissioners Report on the Poor Laws in 1834 for increasing the population, poverty and spending, as well as reducing the incentive to work among the poor. The minimum income was later attacked by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels for supplementing rural wages while increasing the profits of farmers (who formed the English aristocracy). Even Tocqueville wrote that the old Poor Laws created sense of entitlement with disastrous consequences: The number of illegitimate children and criminals grows rapidly and continuously, the indigent population is limitless, the spirit of foresight and saving becomes more and more alien to the poor. More than a century later, a minimum income took on new life, in a slightly different form. In the 1960s, the economist Milton Friedman proposed a minimum income that was financed through a progressive income tax system. The idea experienced criticism for nearly identical reasons to the minimum income under the old Poor Laws. However, a version of Friedman’s idea was adopted as the Earned Income Tax Credit a little more than a decade later, which is still a component of the U.S. tax code. Worrying about technological unemployment is also not new, even though the term initially came into use around World War I and peaked in popularity during the Great Depression. The Luddites famously led violent protests of machinery that replaced jobs in British mills during the early 19th century, or the same period during which a minimum income of the old Poor Laws was being hotly debated. Today, many who are worried about the future of work and technological unemployment suggest that this time it’s different. The computational powers of deep learning neural networks will soon create robots that will replace the human role in every current job currently present. And that may be true. However, though it is extremely difficult to predict the future nature of work, we can bet on the future of technology complimenting human talents in new and exciting ways. Similar to the past, those arguing the pros and cons of a minimum income would be better off changing focus altogether. Rather than debating competing systems to alleviate poverty, public policy should be focused on integrating the poor into an expanding overall economy to end real poverty altogether. Public policy should focus on eliminating licensing restrictions, improving access to capital, as well as tax and regulatory reform that allows creative people with good ideas to compete without having to employee an entire team of tax accounts and lawyers. These reforms should be bipartisan and are the real secret to reducing poverty and improving opportunity — something that both a minimum income and the current welfare state have no shot at achieving."

    "content": "It might seem a pipe dream straight from one of the left-wing darlings of the moment: a guaranteed regular paycheck from the government. But universal basic income (UBI) has its fans on the right as well, including no less than Charles Murray, the pioneering conservative scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who in 2016 called it our only hope to deal with a coming labor market unlike any in human history and said it represents our best hope to revitalize American civil society. Billionaire entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley have backed UBI, as it’s known in the circles that debate it. And top economists endorsed some version of a UBI during last year’s economics summit in Lindau, Germany. The idea attracts both those concerned with perceived wealth inequality and the eradication of jobs through accelerating technology, as well as those who view the sprawling, modern system of social support and transfer payments as too costly and demeaning to recipients. But it’s yet to actually catch fire among the politicians who would have to translate the theory into action. Sen. Bernard Sanders, who lit the liberal fire within the Democratic Party with his 2016 presidential bid, says a UBI is worth exploring, but he hasn’t actually backed it. His acolyte, Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also has kept at it arm’s length: The only public utterance the avowed socialist appears to have made was a tweet on April 2 that read, UBI is still being hashed out on a macroeconomic level, I believe. While conservatives have mocked some of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s economic ideas about things like unemployment, she is largely correct in her assessment of UBI, at least in the United States. What Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who knocked off longtime Rep. Joe Crowley of New York in a Democratic primary last month, has embraced is a federal job guarantee, another concept that is often bandied about in discussions that include the universal basic income. But the job guarantee is more akin to the New Deal’s federal work program, whereas a UBI is exactly as advertised: a tax-free fixed income. Some futurists say a UBI will have to happen, saying it’s the only solution in an economy where robots and artificial intelligence will perform more work. Indeed, support for the idea is growing in polls — though it remains far more popular among the political left than it is on the right. Some pilot UBI programs have been launched. The jury remains out on whether they are effective. In Finland, for example, a random sample of 2,000 unemployed people began receiving 560 euros a month in 2016. The Finnish agency that runs the program, Kela, had sought an extension of it, but the government rejected that and the program will wind down next year as planned. The statistics and findings from that pilot program remain a closely guarded secret and aren’t expected to be made public until 2019 or 2020. In Ontario, Canada, a small-scale UBI program also began in 2017, and in Scotland, too, a debate about UBI began in November, when the government announced it was providing more than $325,000 in seed money to begin UBI programs in pockets of Edinburgh and Glasgow. In the U.S., some municipalities are moving toward some form of UBI, including the California city of Stockton, which declared bankruptcy in 2012 and hopes to float its UBI in August. The money to provide 300,000 people there with $500 a month won’t come from the straitened public coffers, however, but from outside groups. The first $1 million has been provided by a pro-basic income and advocacy group called the Economic Security Project, funded largely by Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. ‘A redistributive society?’ None of the tests, however, have touched on the biggest hurdle: the cost. The theoretical case for a Universal Basic Income is actually quite strong, said Michael D. Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. But if you did one around $10,000 a year for every single American — George Soros, Bill Gates, poor people — it would cost more than the entire current federal budget. The money the federal government spends on redistributive and transfer payments, plus all that goes into traditional social safety net programs is an immense sum, swollen by the bureaucracies that run it all. Indeed, economists note that if the figure was divided by the number of households in the U.S. at or near the poverty level, a check could simply be sent to each such household and that would theoretically end poverty. The price tag is the UBI’s Catch-22. As England’s Institute for Policy Research put it in a paper on the topic, an affordable basic income would be inadequate, and an adequate basic income would be unaffordable. Tweaks could be made. For example, Mr. Tanner noted you could do it by household rather than individual, which would still be extraordinarily expensive but would at least go a long way toward realizing one of UBI’s great benefits from a conservative or libertarian standpoint: reducing that mammoth current federal budget. Or, as Nobel laureate Christopher Pissarides has posited, the UBI must be calibrated so it does not exceed minimum wage and thus throw the labor market out of whack. From the liberal point of view, however, UBI is usually seen as a supplement to the existing panoply of transfer payments and social safety net most Western nations already have in place. They often place it alongside plans for universal government-sponsored health care, tuition-free college and other expansive spending proposals as the cornerstones of a liberal vision. Mr. Murray, in his 2016 Wall Street Journal piece on UBI, said that can’t happen. A UBI will do the good things I claim only if it replaces all other transfer payments and the bureaucracies that oversee them, he wrote. If the guaranteed income is an add-on to the existing system, it will be as destructive as its critics fear. Mr. Tanner warned that the entire UBI concept could crash if it isn’t worked out completely before it is proposed as policy. Either the left or the right will desert a plan they think jettisons their overarching goal. Such evaporating support has doomed UBI-like plans in the past, some experts said. Economist Milton Friedman’s idea of a negative income tax was incorporated by George McGovern in his 1972 presidential bid, then usurped by Richard Nixon in a proposal crafted by Daniel Patrick Moynihan at the time. Nixon’s move took away any wind McGovern may have gotten from the idea, and the proposal died in Washington. I don’t think they’re going to be fliers for that reason, said Varadarajan V. Chari, an economic professor at the University of Minnesota who specializes in tax policy and public economics. The proponents of UBI as an add-on do not seem to have an understanding of how huge tax increases would impact the behavior of the affluent and the economy as a whole. Yet those who envision the UBI as a cheaper alternative often have unrealistic ideas about where the UBI would have to be set, Mr. Chari said. The idea that a UBI in the neighborhood of $10,000 to $13,000, with some portion of that dedicated to health insurance — figures that are often given in association with UBI schemes — will never prove sufficient to replace government’s existing framework. The political catch, Mr. Chari believes, is that while policies that serve as essentially insurance against catastrophe enjoy broad public support in America those seen as purely redistributive do not. When people see it correctly as paying a premium against something that there but for the grace of God go I, then almost everyone supports it, he said. But what is the level we want to reach as a redistributive society? That is where the rubber meets the road in the United States."

    "content": "One of the youngest mayors in the country, who garnered national attention for starting a privately funded program to give poor people $500 a month in guaranteed income, conceded that he lost his bid for reelection in his California city. Four years after winning more than 70% of the vote, Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs, 30, lost by more than 10 percentage points. He conceded the race to Kevin Lincoln on Tuesday after an update of counted ballots showed he trailed by nearly 12,000 votes, with fewer than 12,000 ballots left to count. I am honored to have served as your mayor, and I will continue to support the work needed to move our city forward, Tubbs said in a news release. I congratulate Kevin Lincoln and wish him the best as our new mayor. It was a surprising defeat for Tubbs, the city’s first Black mayor, whose previous political campaigns were endorsed by the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Barack Obama. His compelling personal history - raised by a single mother while his father was in prison before getting a degree from Stanford and interning at the Obama White House - earned him national attention. But he was most known for being one of the first mayors to revive a universal basic income, an old idea that got new life as the key plank in Andrew Yang’s unsuccessful presidential campaign. Last year, Tubbs started the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, a privately funded program that gave 125 people $500 a month for two years to spend however they wanted. A team of academic researchers is monitoring the participants to measure the money’s impact on a range of issues, including mental and physical health. Financed in part by the nonprofit led by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, the program included a storytelling component that resulted in lots of news coverage, part of Tubbs’ goal to push other governments to adopt similar programs. Since then, mayors in 25 other cities have pledged to start their own guaranteed income programs as part of a group that Tubbs founded called Mayors for a Guaranteed Income. The program, plus some of Tubbs’ other initiatives, made him a star. But it was an image that didn’t sit well with some of Stockton’s voters, according to Lee Neves, a Stockton-based political consultant who was not involved in the campaign. Stockton is a blue-collar town, and Michael brought in some ideas that I don’t think a lot of Stockton was comfortable with, he said. Voters chose Lincoln, a 40-year-old Republican who is Latino and Black. He was born and raised in Stockton but left to join the Marines in 2001. He later landed an assignment on Marine One, the helicopter that carries the president, during George W. Bush’s administration. He returned to California and worked for a private security company in Silicon Valley before coming home to Stockton to be executive pastor of LifeSong Church. Lincoln said he’s already left his job at the church and will take office in January. He won’t oversee Tubbs’ guaranteed income program because it is run by a nonprofit that’s separate from the city. He said his goal is to focus on the priorities of Stockton residents. There has been a disconnect and a lack of trust and transparency between the residents of Stockton and their elected (officials), Lincoln said. Putting the needs and priorities of the people of Stockton first is going to take each and every one of us increasing our level of engagement."

Then there's the matter of unemployment, kicked off by the COVID-19 pandemic and likely to worsen because of the technological revolution, there are going to be fewer and fewer jobs for people to do.

    "URL": "https://www.theblaze.com/news/oakland-guaranteed-income-minority-families",
    "content": "Officials in Oakland, California, announced the launch of a guaranteed income pilot program this week that will provide direct monthly payments to low-income minority families in the city. The initiative, which is one of the largest guaranteed income experiments to be conducted in the United States to date, aims to find out if providing regular payments low-income families will lift them from their economic plight. What are the details? The program, called Oakland Resilient Families, will send 600 families in the city $500-a-month payments over the next 18 months as part of an effort to eliminate racial wealth inequalities in the city, which the program argues is the result of ongoing systemic racism. Though similar in many ways to universal basic income, Oakland's guaranteed income program is not designed for everyone, but specifically for low-income black, indigenous, and people of color, or BIPOC, families — groups the city says suffer from the greatest level of wealth disparity. Recipients of the payments will be able to spend the money in any way they choose. Families must apply online in the coming weeks and months in order to enter a pool of potential recipients, from which eligible families will be randomly selected to receive the cash payments. Eligible families are those at or below 50% of the median income level for the area, which is about $59,000 per year for a family of three. However, half of the spots in the program will be reserved for very-low-income families, which are those earning below 138% of the federal poverty level, or roughly $30,000 annually for a family of three. According to the Oakland Resilient Families About page, the program will also be open to undocumented residents and unsheltered families. What else? While announcing the program during a news conference Tuesday, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said, We believe that guaranteed income is the most transformative policy that can achieve this vision and whose time has come. According to KPIX-TV, Schaaf noted that once the program kicks off in the spring and summer, evaluators will be tasked with monitoring how the money is spent and how much of an impact the payments made on the recipients' lives. Officials reportedly emphasized that none of the money to be distributed through the program will come from taxpayers; rather, the funds will be raised through philanthropic donations. A reported $6.75 million has been raised for the program so far."

    "content": "Pope Francis used an Easter message to advocate for a socialist universal basic wage. Writing to the leaders of social movements across the globe, Francis said universal basic income, something that only far-left American politicians support, would achieve an ideal. This may be the time to consider a universal basic wage which would acknowledge and dignify the noble, essential tasks you carry out, Francis wrote. It would ensure and concretely achieve the ideal, at once so human and so Christian, of no worker without rights. Francis went on to write that western civilization needs to downshift from its individualistic way of life rife with disproportionate profits. Our civilization — so competitive, so individualistic, with its frenetic rhythms of production and consumption, its extravagant luxuries, its disproportionate profits for just a few — needs to downshift, take stock, and renew itself, he said. The thrust of Francis's Easter message is consistent with the core biblical theme of justice for vulnerable and marginalized people — the widow, orphan, immigrant, and poor — those to whom Jesus first brought his message about the Kingdom of God. Francis was addressing the great needs of these communities, and those who serve them, in light of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Catholic American Magazine, Francis is steering policymakers toward a transformative frame for economic thinking — one that is not zero-sum under current conditions but that alters the terrain altogether, as universal cash payments could do. Still, despite advocating for UBI, Francis said that state-based and market-based solutions will not be ultimately sufficient. My hope is that governments understand that technocratic paradigms (whether state-centred or market-driven) are not enough to address this crisis or the other great problems affecting humankind, he wrote. Now more than ever, persons, communities and peoples must be put at the centre, united to heal, to care and to share. Spain is one such country that has already committed to immediately implement UBI to blunt the economic fallout from COVID-19."

    "content": "Spain is responding to the coronavirus crisis with a plan to launch a universal basic income program in the near future, Forbes reported, but the program isn't just for the pandemic — it will become permanent, Spain's Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said. What's the story? Spain, like other nations whose economies have been devastated by the coronavirus-related shutdowns, passed a stimulus package to ease the disruption. Measures include pausing all mortgage payments and giving money to businesses that are struggling. The next step is a universal basic income that Calvino said is a direct response to the coronavirus emergency, but which will also remain after COVID-19 has passed. From Bloomberg: Social Security Minister Jose Luis Escriva is coordinating the project and plans to put some sort of basic income in place as soon as possible, with the main focus on assisting families, Calvino, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said in an interview Sunday night with Spanish broadcaster La Sexta. But the government's broader ambition is that basic income becomes an instrument that stays forever, that becomes a structural instrument, a permanent instrument, she said. Desperate times, desperate measures: Spain is among the countries hardest hit by COVID-19, along with China, Italy, and the United States. More than 13,000 people in Spain have reportedly died from the coronavirus. Spain using an emergency to implement a drastic, permanent policy change like universal basic income is an example of what some in the U.S. fear politicians will attempt to do. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said last week that he views the coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity to move toward a new progressive era. South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn said last month that the crisis presented a chance for Democrats to restructure things to fit our vision. The economic problems in the U.S. have led Congress to pass a stimulus bill that includes direct cash payments to Americans based on their reported income. There are no plans at this time for future aid payments, although that is subject to change depending on the length of time non-essential businesses are closed."

    "content": "As neoliberal politics continues to transcend traditional Democratic Party values, progressive lawmakers are advocating for increasing far-left policies that more reflect socialism than the values that have glued America together for more than two centuries. One of those far-left policies is a universal basic income, for which some 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, like Andrew Yang, advocate. However, a new study released this week testing the merits of UBI reveals such a policy is only a charitable idea that would utterly fail in practice. What are the details? The New Economics Foundation study, which co-author Anna Coote detailed in The Guardian, explained that current methods to implement universal basic income are not sustainable, nor does UBI deliver on its promises to help the impoverished rise out of their circumstances. The study concluded: UBI is not a viable route to solving economic problems caused or exacerbated by neoliberal market economics; There is no evidence that any version of UBI can be affordable, inclusive, sufficient and sustainable; and UBI will not aid working class people to increase the bargaining power of workers and trade unions or solve problems of low pay and precarious work. In sum, the study concluded that UBI is not the silver bullet that its proponents often claim it is. Instead of dolling out cash payments to each citizen regardless of class or income, the study suggest resources would be better spent on reforming social protection systems, and building more and better-quality public services. In one of the most notable experiments to date, Finland announced last year that it would abandon its UBI experiment after providing a wide demographic of 2,000 Finnish citizens about $690 per month for two years. Italy has implemented a similar program. Anything else? In addition to Yang, Democrats such as freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) support universal basic income. Among 2020 Democratic contenders, however, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is the next closest to supporting UBI via a tax-credit proposal that would give up to $500 per month to working families. Meanwhile, the California Democratic Party officially endorsed supporting UBI last year."

    "content": "The mayor of the largest city in New Jersey announced recently his plan to explore the possibility of universal basic income for all residents, WNYW-TV reported. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said last Tuesday that he would be creating a task force and pilot program to determine whether or not the plan would be feasible for the city of 280,000. We believe in universal basic income, especially in a time where studies have shown that families that have a crisis of just $400 in a month may experience a setback that may be difficult, even impossible, to recover from, Baraka said, according to WNYW. Baraka, who made the announcement during his State of the City address at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, didn't provide further details on how the city would fund such a program. Universal basic income typically provides a guaranteed monthly income to residents regardless of their employment status. What else did the mayor say? The mayor reportedly touted the city's economic progress just before announcing his plan to explore universal basic income. The problems we have belong to all of us, not just a few of us so the solutions must be collective and not individual, Baraka said, according to Fox News. About one-third of the city's residents are living in poverty, he added. What other cities have explored basic income? Last month, Stockton, California, launched its 18-month universal basic income pilot program. In February, 100 residents began receiving $500 a month with no strings attached. In July, city officials in Chicago formed a task force that has since recommended an 18-month test that would provide $1,000 a month to 1,000 participants. It is time for cities like Chicago to lead a national dialogue on income inequality, and in part of that, recognize that there is a coming storm, Alderman Ameya Pawar told WBEZ-FM. This sort of confluence of student loans, a lack of affordable housing, and the cost of child care is ... impacting people from the upper middle class all the way down to the working poor. And that is something we're not talking about. Has it worked in other countries? A pilot program in Ontario, Canada, was ditched after lawmakers determined it wasn't sustainable. It was certainly not going to be sustainable. Spending more money on a broken program wasn't going to help anyone, Lisa MacLeod, the Ontario minister responsible for social services, said in July. Similarly, Finland ended its two-year experiment that gave 2,000 unemployed citizens about $650 per month with no strings attached and no requirement to gain employment. A preliminary report issued last month showed that those who received the monthly stipend were no more likely to gain employment than those who were part of the control group and didn't receive the basic income. On the basis of an analysis of register data on an annual level, we can say that during the first year of the experiment the recipients of a basic income were no better or worse than the control group at finding employment in the open labor market, said Ohto Kanninen, research coordinator at the Labour Institute for Economic Research, according to Bloomberg."

    "content": "Despite recent failures of similar programs in other countries, a California city is gearing up for a universal basic income trial program to begin early next year, according to Business Insider. Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, California, where the trial will take place, announced details of the program Monday. The trial is scheduled to last 18 months. We hope to challenge the entrenched stereotypes and assumptions about the poor, and the working poor, that paralyze our pursuit of more aggressive solutions, read a report from Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, which is providing the money. We aim to illustrate how widespread and episodic poverty is. Tubbs and SEED are optimistic about the program, despite the recent failure of a three-year program in Canada that ended after only a year, and the non-renewal of a similar program in Finland. What are the new details? The SEED universal basic income program is scheduled to begin in February 2019 and run for a year and a half. Under the program, 100 residents will be selected to receive $500 dollars per month, to use however they like. One thousand residences in eligible neighborhoods will be randomly selected by SEED and given the opportunity to apply for the program, then SEED will randomly select 100 from the group that applies. Eligible neighborhoods include those with a median income of $46,033 or less, although individuals who earn more than that can be selected if they live in an eligible neighborhood. Researchers will monitor those receiving the money to see what impact it may have on health, civic engagement, and financial security, and compare the results to a control group that will also be monitored during that period. Who is paying for this? The trial program will be funded by donations from several individuals and organizations. From Business Insider: The city's basic income pilot is fully funded by private donations, not tax dollars, according to a SEED report released Monday. Donors include Facebook co-founder Andrew McCollum and sociologist Gretchen Sisson, who is McCollum's wife. The Economic Security Project— co-chaired by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, Center for Community Change Action president Dorian Warren, and Peers.org co-founder Natalie Foster — is a major donor as well. Tubbs, whom some residents recently wanted removed from office for wasteful spending and lack of concern for the community, said he wants to change the perception toward people in poverty. In our economic structure, the people who work the hardest oftentimes make the least, Tubbs told Business Insider for a previous article. I know migrant farm workers who do back-breaking labor every day, or Uber drivers and Lyft drivers who drive 10 to 12 hours a day in traffic. You can't be lazy doing that kind of work."

Speaking at the 2018 TED Conference, Google's chief futurist and director of engineering Ray Kurzweil, who boasts an 86 percent accuracy rate for his nearly 150 predictions since 1990, made another bold prediction about the role of AI in our future: In the early 2030s, we'll have universal basic income in the developed world, and worldwide by the end of the 2030s. You'll be able to live very well on that. The primary concern will be meaning and purpose. In the early 2030s, we'll have universal basic income in the developed world, and worldwide by the end of the 2030s. You'll be able to live very well on that. The primary concern will be meaning and purpose. — Ray Kurzweil #TED2018 — TED Talks (@TEDTalks) April 13, 2018 Here are a few more of Kurzweil's more noteworthy predictions: By 2029, computers will have reached human-level intelligence, a.k.a. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). By 2030, nanotechnology and other medical advances will have cured nearly all diseases. By 2045, artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence. This is called the singularity. Kurzweil believes that this new technological singularity will usher in, and I want to quote here, a 'period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed.' Wow, that's quite a quote, said Glenn on today's show. Here's the problem with Kurzweil's prediction: He claims that the time-frame between human level artificial intelligence and [the singularity] will be about 15 years. But there are others that say it could be 15 hours ... we don't know."

They’re written off, Tubbs said. They don’t have the money because there is something wrong with them, and I want to demonstrate that when given the opportunity that people, especially the people of Stockton, will make good choices and the right choices for themselves and their families. Another part of the program includes hiring three artists to create murals that will be used to start a conversation on the universal basic income project so that people will take it upon themselves and go and do research on it, and see how impactful it can be for our community. Where is the money coming from? The program will be funded by the Economic Security Project as a part of the Universal Income Project. Universal basic income is a simple idea that could have a radical impact on our society: give people enough money to meet their basic needs, providing everyone in the country with an income floor, the website reads. Basic income could eliminate absolute poverty, support entrepreneurship and creativity, and allow every American to share in the prosperity that we have created together as a nation. What’s the current status of the program? A director was hired to oversee the program in February, and now the city is seeking a research partner to help develop eligibility guidelines. Right now, there are no work requirements for a person to receive the $500 per month. The money will be tracked in the planning phase to see how recipients are spending it."

In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg said: Seeing how Alaska put this dividend in place reminded me of a lesson I learned early at Facebook: organizations think profoundly differently when they're profitable than when they're in debt. When you're losing money, your mentality is largely about survival. But when you're profitable, you're confident about your future and you look for opportunities to invest and grow further. Alaska's economy has historically created this winning mentality, which has led to this basic income. That may be a lesson for the rest of the country as well."

(2/2) https://t.co/cLc7PgvICc — Christy Gilbert Holstege (@christyholstege) April 1, 2022 In the City of Palm Springs, we are proud to be a beacon of hope to the rest of the nation, Christy Holstege, the council member behind the plan, said on Twitter. We’ve worked hard to build an inclusive community. Our latest proposes a guaranteed income pilot program for trans and non-binary people. The council voted unanimously last week in favor of the social justice policy, according to the Daily Mail, which noted that the transgender mayor, who goes by the female name Lisa Middleton, has doubts about the plan: My serious concern is the ability of these guaranteed income programs to scale up to the magnitude of the issues that are before us, said, despite voting in favor of the pilot program. I have been wrong many times. The Palm Springs experiment will be partially funded by the state, which has set aside $35 million for experiments in guaranteed income programs – something which became a hot topic when Andrew Yang ran for the 2020 presidential election on a platform that included universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000 a month for everyone over 18. Fox News reported on opposition to the plan from another gay local official. Former San Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio, a Republican who served as the first openly gay member of the city council, called the program outrageous and discriminatory. We’re completely opposed to guaranteed or universal basic income programs, because they ultimately cause inflation and raise the cost of living on everyone — they don’t work, DeMaio said in a statement. But at least some of them have minimum income requirements to qualify, whereas this one is no-strings-attached ‘woke’ virtue signaling to the LGBT community in a way that is not only offensive but discriminatory, he continued."

    "content": "Rep. Pete Stauber (R-MN) is introducing legislation designed to block states and localities from using federal coronavirus relief funds for basic income programs, which disincentives work, he announced on Wednesday. The bill, the Stop Disincentivizing Work Act, specifically prohibits certain federal funding from being used for certain cash assistance programs — namely, basic income programs such as the pilot program recently introduced in Minneapolis. Specifically, funding authorized by The Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, The CARES Act, The Consolidated Appropriations Act, and The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 would be prohibited from being used for such programs, guaranteeing basic income. I have heard firsthand accounts from countless small businesses owners who are struggling to find workers to fill their job openings. This massive labor shortage was a preventable problem caused by policies that disincentivized work, Stauber said in a statement. Federal dollars cannot be going towards programs that will only exacerbate this problem. It is far past time we fully reopen our economy and get people back to work. I will not sit by as Democrats across the nation continue to pay able-bodied people with our taxpayer dollars not to work, he added as Minnesota Reps.

According to the outlet, the families participating in the program will receive $500 every month for two years. Because the pilot is funded with $3 million in American Rescue Plan Act money, participants must have been adversely impacted by COVID-19, the outlet reported. Rep. Fischbach ripped the city for its plans to use the funds to provide what she described as an unconditional taxpayer funded paycheck to a small number of people. U.S. Rep.

This is a cruel social experiment and working Americans should not have their taxes spent on this socialist experiment, she said."

Similar pilot efforts, called universal basic income, have been tested elsewhere including in California and New York, according to the report. Between 18 percent and 20 percent of Chicagoans live in poverty, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. However, other government financial assistance in the city — especially welfare — has been accused of exacerbating the city’s poverty problem. The research suggests that future anti-poverty policies will be most successful if they directly incentivize labor force participation, the Chicago Policy Review reported. The Illinois Policy Institute went as far as to say that welfare can disincentivize people from finding better-paying jobs because they would no longer qualify for government assistance.

Currently, Italians, EU citizens, or legal immigrants who have lived in the country for at least ten years are eligible for the citizens’ income, so long as household income does not exceed €9,360 ($11,040/£8,000). Criticism came immediately from members of the centre-right coalition, such as populist Senator Matteo Salvini who called the ideaabsurd\" and demanded that the government help Italians facing difficulties first.

The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified after the Civil War, includes the Equal Protection Clause in Section 1, providing that no state shalldeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" A century-and-a-half of jurisprudence has established that if any government discriminates among citizens on the basis of race, its policy must meet the standard ofstrict scrutiny:\" it can only do to to achieve acompelling governing interest,\" and must benarrowly tailored\" to do so. Oakland’s policy fails that test. The newpilot\" program, as described by Mayor Libby Schaaf, aims to repeat an experiment inuniversal basic income\" first tried in Stockton, California. But that program did not discriminate on the basis of race; the only selection criteria were thatrecipients had to be at least 18 years old, reside in Stockton, and live in a neighborhood with a median income at or below $46,033.\" The 125 households that received the grant were chosen randomly, through the mail.

    "content": "German researchers will give 120 people €1,200 a month for three years to see how their behaviour changes, after a study in Finland found that a similar experiment did not encourage unemployed Finns to find work. Initiated on Tuesday, researchers began the process of opening applications for Germany’s long-term study on universal basic income (UBI), where 120 people will receive €1,200 (£1,080/$1,400) regardless of employment status or financial means. A control group of 1,380 people in comparable life situations will not be given any money but will be monitored to examine how the UBI test subjects’ behaviour change over time. The My Basic Income association backed the project, which is funded by private donors. German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) researcher Jürgen Schupp told Der Spiegel on Tuesday that the initiative was not merely an experiment in whether free money makes Germans happy.Happiness research has long since proven that more money increases well-being. But we want to find out a lot more: To what extent does such a reliable, unconditional flow of money affect people’s attitudes and behaviour — in relevant areas of life? How do, for example, professional life, daily structure, commitment, diet, or relationships change? And how does that differ depending on age, area of residence, other earnings and so on? That’s a lot of exciting and so far unanswered questions,\" Mr Schupp said. This is not the first time a European Union country has conducted research on giving citizens free money. A project in 2017 in Finland found that giving unemployed people a monthly income of €560 (£490/$634) did not encourage them to find work; however, researchers found that they did feel better than those in the control group that received no money. Universal basic income has become a major campaigning point for far-leftists in the American Democratic party, including Ilhan Omar, and former presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Finland’s ‘Free Money’ Experiment Failed to Encourage Unemployed to Find Work https://t.co/8wn7p28zvb — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 9, 2019 However, at the start of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, figures on the right tentatively embraced the notion of a temporary UBI as countries went into lockdown and businesses began furloughing staff. In March, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called forhelicopter money\" of £1,000 to be paid to every adult for three months, fearing that 11 million Britons without a fixed income would suffer. The United States passed similar legislation that month. The UK did not go down that route, instead opting for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, where employers could claim back from the government 80 per cent of their staff’s wages if they were put on furlough due to the pandemic. Several European countries followed a similar route of furlough payments. Germany is reportedly planning on extending its furlough scheme for two years, at an estimated cost of €10billion (£9bn/$11.9bn), The UK’s scheme is set to end in October and has cost some £35 billion. Last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Britons it was time to go back to work, saying:It’s very important that people should be going back to work if they can now. I think everybody has sort of taken the ‘stay at home if you can’ — I think we should now say, well, ‘go back to work if you can’.\" Analysis from Morgan Stanley’s research unit AlphaWise found earlier this month that compared to Germans (70 per cent), Italians (76 per cent), the French (83 per cent), and the Spanish (73 per cent), British white-collar workers were the most reluctant to return to the office (34 per cent). Only just over half (52 per cent) of all British workers have returned to work, compared to around three-quarters of Germans, Italians, and Spanish, and 83 per cent of the French. The economic cost of the pandemic is already being felt in the UK, with the country going into recession for the first time in 11 years. #YangGang: Despite Failures in Finland, U.S., British City Wants to Try Universal Basic Income https://t.co/QHsRP8zkyM — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 22, 2020"

    "content": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has reportedly donated $3 million to fund Mayors for a Guaranteed Income (MGI) a new coalition of 15 mayors across the country launching a universal basic income pilot program. Forbes reports that Jack Dorsey, the billionaire CEO of social media site Twitter and payment platform Square, has donated $3 million to fund Mayors for a Guaranteed Income (MGI), a coalition of 15 mayors across the United States who plan to launch a universal basic income pilot program. The program would see residents of the cities receive a recurring payment each month. The coalition was launched by Michael Tubbs, the mayor of Stockton, California, who has been running a guaranteed income pilot program in his city since 2018. Tubbs told Forbes: Mayors are the moral leaders of the country. They’re on the frontlines dealing with, responding to and working for constituents each and every day. Given Covid-19 and the need for regular ongoing cash assistance, and also the protests on not just police violence but structural violence in the city, I knew it was time to leverage what we’ve learned in Stockton and create a network of mayors and advocate with a collective voice for guaranteed cash payments. The majority of the money donated by Dorsey will help to create pilot programs for UBI in cities including Newark, Atlanta, Seattle, Los Angeles, Compton, Long Beach, Pittsburgh, Oakland, and more. Most of the mayors in MGI are currently left-leaning, but Tubbs believes that will soon change.Economic insecurity is something that’s bipartisan,\" says Tubbs.Some of the most red states have the highest rates of economic insecurity and poverty… In the next couple of months, you’ll see some of the more ‘conservative’ mayors (in MGI).\" The donation by Dorsey was made from #StartSmall, his philanthropic limited liability company that was launched on April 7 by transferring $1 billion worth of Square shares to the LLC. Dorsey said the company would focus mainly on Wuhan coronavirus relief efforts but would also fund efforts to improve girl’s health and education and UBI experiments. Dorsey has also donated $11.2 million to GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that has become popular in Silicon Valley due to its promising work with UBI in Kenya and Uganda."

    "content": "Support for Universal Basic Income (UBI), businessman Andrew Yang’s signature policy position, is growing among American voters, a new poll reveals. A Rasmussen Reports survey finds that, in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis, more American voters support UBI — whereby each U.S. citizen would receive $1,000 a month — than they did almost two years ago. Voters are mostly split on the issue, with 43 percent opposing UBI and about 40 percent supporting such a program. Yang has long contended that UBI could replace all current welfare services as a cheaper alternative to taxpayers while providing aid to working- and middle-class Americans. Support for UBI has grown particularly among Republicans. Today, about 26 percent of GOP voters support UBI for U.S. citizens and 61 percent oppose. In July 2018, less than 20 percent of GOP voters supported UBI and nearly 75 percent opposed — indicating a 37 percent increase in support for UBI among Republicans over less than two years. Young American voters are more and more supporting UBI, with about 55 percent of those 18 to 39 years old saying they favor the economic plan and only 31 percent opposing. Almost two years ago, a little more than 40 percent of these young voters supported UBI while 37 percent opposed the plan. The survey comes as President Donald Trump’s administration will soon begin issuing $1,200 checks to nearly all American citizens in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. The plan has received endorsements from figures like Yang and also on the conservative side of the aisle, including Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Josh Hawley (R-MO). In the last week, more than 6.6 million Americans have filed jobless claims. The week before, about 3.3 million Americans filed jobless claims."

Warren expressed her willingness to consider a UBI, which quite literally amounts to the government handing individuals and families abasic\" income per month regardless of employment or income status, in a Washington Post survey that asked,Should the federal government pay a universal basic income to every American adult?\" Three candidates were listed as supporting the measure – Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Marianne Williamson (D), and Yang. Notably, two candidates were listed asopen to it\" – Julián Castro (D) and Warren.We absolutely must raise wages and strengthen the social safety net so that every American has basic financial security. Universal basic income and universal living wages are options to consider,\" Warren told the Post, noting her push for a $15 minimum wage. She continued: To raise wages, I have pushed for a $15 minimum wage, stronger unions, and empowering American workers at big American corporations to elect no less than 40 percent of the company board members — giving workers a powerful voice in corporate decisions about wages and benefits. Her position is drastically different than Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT), who typically holds similar views to Warren. He has openly expressed skepticism of a universal basic income, contending that his federal jobs guarantee is better becausepeople want to work.\"We take a very different approach from Mr. Yang and that is I believe in a jobs guarantee,\" Sanders told Hill.TV in August.

It will come about one day. The concept is called universal basic income. It guarantees every person a minimum income regardless of age, wealth, job status, hometown or family size. Some countries are already experimenting with it. Branson is one of many business leaders who have voiced support. During a commencement address at Harvard last year, Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, We should explore ideas like universal basic income to make sure that everyone has a cushion to try new ideas. Related: Richard Branson is 'jealous' of Elon Musk's rocket launch For Branson, guaranteed basic income is a way to protect people who may one day lose their jobs to artificial intelligence. His sentiments echo those of SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who told CNBC last year that a universal basic income could be an outcome of automation. Proponents of the plan say the aim is to give workers greater financial security as concerns rise about machines taking away jobs, in addition to alleviating income inequality. Critics say the idea has good intentions, but doesn't solve bigger problems related to poor wage growth. They also say it challenges the notion that you need to work to earn money. Related: Mark Zuckerberg supports universal basic income. What is it? Branson recommended that cities start experimenting with a universal basic income. Canada and Finland give guaranteed income to people who were either recently on unemployment benefits or are low income. Other countries have rejected the idea altogether.

We should explore ideas like universal basic income to make sure that everyone has a cushion to try new ideas, Zuckerberg said at his Harvard commencement address Thursday. So, what exactly is it? It's a concept that's getting a lot of attention, especially in Silicon Valley. A country that has universal basic income guarantees every person a set minimum income regardless of criteria -- age, wealth, job status, hometown, family size, etc. That means everyone gets a paycheck, whether they have a job or not. However, the countries actually experimenting with the concept, Canada and Finland, aren't embracing the universal nature of it. So far, they're only giving guaranteed income to residents who were were either recently on unemployment benefits or are low income. Related: US economy grows only 1.2% in first quarter Proponents say the aim is to give workers greater financial security as concerns rise about machines taking away jobs. It's also intended to alleviate income inequality. Critics say the idea has good intentions but it doesn't solve bigger problems related to abysmal wage growth in recent decades. They also say it challenges the notion that you need to work to earn money. It's a misguided mission, says Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research center. It's a tech CEO view of the world that I think is distorted. Countries are experimenting with UBI in varying degrees. Starting this year, Finland is giving out a guaranteed monthly income of nearly $600 to 2,000 citizens. The citizens were randomly selected but had to have received unemployment benefits or an income subsidy. The money they are paid isn't taxed. It's a two-year program that could be expanded nationwide depending on the results. Related: Ontario launches guaranteed income program for 4,000 residents Canada's province of Ontario, which includes Toronto, started a pilot program in April that provides 4,000 citizens with an unconditional income of about $12,600 a year. Applicants must be between ages 18 and 64 and living on a limited income. But there are plenty of skeptics. Voters in Switzerland shot down a referendum last year to provide a basic income to citizens. Could the US ever implement a system of universal basic income? It looks highly unlikely. Experts argue that a UBI program and the costs associated with it could put other US safety net programs -- social security, Medicaid, Medicare, Pell grants for low-income college students -- at risk. The US is also going in the opposite direction on similar programs like unemployment insurance. Some states, like Florida and North Carolina, have reduced those benefits to 13 and 12 weeks respectively, down from the typical 26 weeks paid out by most states."

    "author": "Ivana Kottasová",
    "URL": "http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/05/news/economy/italy-basic-income-election-five-star/index.html",
    "content": "The populist party that scooped up the most votes in Italy's election made a bold campaign promise: a guaranteed income of €780 ($960) a month for everyone. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) on Monday described the election result as a triumph. But its most eye-catching policy is highly unlikely to happen. Here's why. 1. There's no majority M5S attracted voters fed up with Italy's weak economic recovery, and it dominated in the south of the country, receiving almost one in two votes in a region where youth unemployment is very high. After Sunday's vote, the movement is on track to become the biggest party in parliament with about 32% of the vote. That's more than predicted but not enough for it to govern on its own. It promised to top up the incomes of the poor, unemployed and pensioners by increasing taxes on banks and insurance companies, cutting the pensions of the rich and slashing military spending. Universal basic income, which guarantees a minimum level of earnings to everyone in society, has never been rolled out on a national basis. M5S wasn't alone in pushing the idea. Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia made a similar -- but even more generous -- promise of a basic dignity income of €1,000 ($1,230) a month later in the campaign. Related: Italy's economy is still stuck in 1st gear But economists are skeptical the promises could ever turn into a real policy after what are likely to be lengthy negotiations to form a coalition government. My best guess is that they won't be able to push it through, said Jack Allen, European economist at Capital Economics. Even if M5S and Forza Italia join forces they probably wouldn't have enough seats to pass such a radical policy. They may well have promised a universal income in the knowledge that, in all likelihood, there would never be enough support to implement it, Allen added. 2. Italy can't afford it Even if M5S managed to assemble enough votes in parliament, Italy's massive government debt makes such an expensive policy unrealistic. They just don't have the money for it, said Carsten Hesse, European economist at Berenberg. Italy is already running a budget deficit of 2% of GDP. Under European Union rules, the deficit must not exceed 3%. M5S said its basic income would cost €15 billion ($18.5 billion) a year. Oxford Economics estimates the cost at €29 billion ($35.7 billion), equivalent to roughly 1.7% of Italian GDP. Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi pegged it as high as €84 billion ($103 billion). Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, said there would be immense pressure on the new government not to implement the plan. If they go ahead with this, there is no way they would be able to stick with the fiscal targets ... and while [the EU] might give them some leniency, it is unlikely that they would tolerate this, she added. Universal basic income isn't a new concept. Finland has been experimenting with the idea, while the Canadian province of Ontario launched its own pilot last April. Swiss voters rejected a similar idea in a referendum in 2016. These are very successful economies with very low unemployment, solid GDP and small budget deficits, said Hesse. It might make sense for them ... and they can afford it, but in Italy, it's not the case. Related: Why young Italian expats are 'scared' to go home Investors are also likely to be concerned about any increase in the budget deficit, because that would add to Italy's debt, which already stands at 120% of GDP. That's the second highest rate in Europe, after Greece. Manulife's Greene said investors would likely demand a higher rate of interest in return for buying Italian government debt, and that would push up the country's borrowing costs. The Five Star Movement might find governing a lot more difficult than making big promises from the sidelines, much like other populist parties have found before, she added."

    "author": "Zachary B. Wolf",
    "URL": "https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/12/politics/2020-democratic-ideas-primary-andrew-yang/index.html",
    "content": "Andrew Yang departed the Democratic presidential primary Tuesday, taking with him his math pin and business casual debate wardrobe and also one of the more intriguing ideas a Democrat put forward: universal basic income. With it, the Democrats’ ideas primary, once a vibrant discussion about how to improve the country, is, essentially, over. Democrats have settled on health care and, to a lesser extent, college affordability, as their main social programs. The party is united on addressing climate change, but they’ll square off against a party led by Donald Trump, who wants to focus on American fossil fuel production. Progressive proposals pushed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who got the most votes in both Iowa and New Hampshire, are seemingly nonstarters in Washington, certainly with a Republican-controlled Senate and probably even with a slim Democratic majority. There may not be support for the half-measure public health insurance option pushed by more moderate Democrats, much less a root-and-branch remaking of a government-run health care system Sanders champions. Free public college, similarly, would be very difficult to enact. What’s in the middle lane? Other candidates doing well in primaries, like former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar are not associated with transformational ideas so much as their moderation. Klobuchar has an infrastructure plan. So does Trump. Those feel almost small compared to Yang’s radical proposal to give every American a paycheck. That wasn’t the only wild idea we heard this year. Yang’s exit, after getting less than 3% in New Hampshire, came after the departure of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, the climate candidate; New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who pushed for baby bonds; author Marianne Williamson and her ideas about spreading love; Former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro had proposals to deal with poverty and, notably, wanted to decriminalize border crossings, a 180-degree departure from the current President, who wants to build a wall. Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, after a mass shooting in his home town of El Paso, proposed taking certain guns from Americans to deal with the gun violence epidemic. Yang’s big idea But none were as tied to a specific proposal as Yang, a political neophyte. He owed his phenomenal popularity to his embrace of universal basic income. He called it a freedom dividend and it has been proposed by scholars before, but Yang took UBI mainstream – or as mainstream as the Democratic debate stage would let him. The idea is that every adult American should get a $1,000 per month paycheck, regardless of their wealth or income. It would de-stigmatize government assistance while at the same time creating a new safety net and also addressing the growing problems of income inequality. Booker’s ideas One of the smartest ideas that never quite caught fire was Booker’s proposal for baby bonds. The government would give every American child a nest egg to use on college or a business. It would be a way of addressing a generational wealth gap that has disproportionately kept African Americans back in the US economy. But by giving the benefit to every American, it would address inequality throughout the country. Booker, who also pushed criminal justice reform proposals, pitched a universal jobs program pilot, dropped out of the race January 13, without really having gotten a look by voters, at least according to opinion polls. His support for a commission to study reparations is shared by Sanders and Warren, among other candidates. Warren’s plans The biggest idea generator of the race is still campaigning. Elizabeth Warren had a respectable showing in Iowa and a fourth-place finish in New Hampshire. Both were disappointments for a candidate who bragged about having a plan for everything, but has seen some buzz for her campaign fade before the primaries began. She brought the idea of a transformational wealth tax into the primary and said it could pay for her many many proposals, like free college and child care. Sanders now has his own version of a tax on the wealthy to pay for his programs, although the math seems fuzzy. Sanders would still tax income. Warren wanted to tax the actual wealth of the super rich. Warren could still rebound, but she’s not currently in the top tier of the race at the moment. One turning point for her came when she was unable or unwilling to explain how she’d pay for a Medicare for All proposal first pushed by Sanders. She didn’t want to admit she’d have to raise taxes to get it done, instead arguing that lower premiums would offset any tax hikes. Sanders has a lot of policies proposals similar to Warren’s and he rightly still gets credit for the Medicare for All proposal. Health care is a motivating issue for Democrats. In exit polls, 37% of New Hampshire primary voters said health care was their top issue. And Sanders won those voters. But he only got 31% of them. Buttigieg and Klobuchar, who both made very clear during the campaign that they opposed Medicare for All because it would completely replace the private insurance system, combined for 43% of the voters who said health care was their top issue. That suggests the party is extremely split on Sanders’ top proposal. There are, however, strong majorities of Democratic primary voters who favor a government plan for all instead of private insurance (60% in exit polls) and free tuition at public colleges (68%). But that means a lot of the Democratic voters supported a candidate like Buttigieg or Klobuchar, both of whom oppose these big ideas. And if Democrats cannot unite behind a proposal, that means it is very unlikely to pass a US Senate currently controlled by Republicans. It’s an important thing to remember when picking a presidential candidate that big ideas are always very hard to actually make happen."

    "content": "Finland has started a radical experiment: It's giving 2,000 citizens a guaranteed income, with funds that keep flowing whether participants work or not. The program, which kicks off this month, is one of the first efforts to test a universal basic income. Participants will receive €560 ($587) a month -- money that is guaranteed regardless of income, wealth or employment status. The idea is that a universal income offers workers greater security, especially as technological advances reduce the need for human labor. It will also allow unemployed people to pick up odd jobs without losing their benefits. The initial program will run for a period of two years. Participants were randomly selected, but had to be receiving unemployment benefits or an income subsidy. The money they are paid through the program will not be taxed. If the program is successful, it could be expanded to include all adult Finns. The Finnish government thinks the initiative could save money in the long run. The country's welfare system is complex and expensive to run, and simplifying it could reduce costly bureaucracy. The change could also encourage more jobless people to look for work, because they won't have to worry about losing unemployment benefits. Some unemployed workers currently avoid part time jobs because even a small income boost could result in their unemployment benefits being canceled. Incidental earnings do not reduce the basic income, so working and ... self-employment are worthwhile no matter what, said Marjukka Turunen, the head of the legal unit at Kela, Finland's social insurance agency. finland guaranteed income Related: Switzerland rejects plan to pay every citizen at least $2,500 a month The idea is not unique to Finland. Advocates point to the Italian city of Livorno, which started a guaranteed basic income for the city's 100 poorest families in June. The scheme was extended to further 100 families starting Sunday. They are receiving €500 ($525) per month. Pilot programs are also being discussed in Canada, Iceland, Uganda and Brazil. Switzerland last year considered giving every adult citizen a guaranteed income of $2,500 a month, but the plan was rejected in a referendum. More than 75% of voters were against the measure. Related: How does your salary stack up? The best example of a guaranteed income program might actually be in the U.S. Alaska has been giving out annual cash payments to all residents since the 1980s, a dividend from the state's oil revenue.

    "content": "Low-income families of color in Oakland, California, could receive some extra financial assistance over the next year and a half. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced this week that the city will launch a guaranteed income project to give hundreds of Black and Indigenous families and people of color $500 per month for 18 months. The project’s payments will be unconditional, and recipients may spend the money however they choose. The Oakland Resilient Families program is the latest trial of a \"guaranteed income\" system of wealth distribution, where residents are given a set amount of money per month to supplement the existing social safety net. The project targets groups with the city’s greatest wealth disparities, per the Oakland Equality Index, which reveals the median income for White households in Oakland to be nearly three times that of Black households. \"The poverty we all witness today is not a personal failure, it is a systems failure,\" Schaaf said in a statement. \"Guaranteed income is one of the most promising tools for systems change, racial equity and economic mobility we’ve seen in decades.\" Guaranteed income provides security to those who most need it Guaranteed income is different from Universal Basic Income (UBI), which would provide enough income to meet everyone’s basic needs. Instead, guaranteed income is only meant to supplement other wages and programs for low-income residents, helping to build the \"income floor\" on which people in poverty can begin to build financially secure lives. Although the idea has seen a resurgence in recent years, it’s not new – Martin Luther King, Jr. advocated for it in his 1967 book, \"Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?\" \"I’m now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective – the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income,\" King wrote. Other cities have implemented it In 2019, 100 residents in Stockton, California, began receiving unconditional $500 payments. Other initiatives in Newark, New Jersey, and Atlanta, Georgia, were launched as recently as 2020. Former Stockton Mayor, Michael Tubbs, is the founder of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a network of advocating mayors founded in 2020. Oakland Mayor Schaaf is also a founding member of the network. \"One of my hopes in testing out a guaranteed income is that other cities would follow suit, and I’m thrilled that Oakland is among the first,\" Tubbs said. \"By focusing on BIPOC residents, the Oakland Resilient Families program will provide critical financial support to those hardest hit by systemic inequities, including the pandemic’s disproportionate toll on communities of color.\" Oakland Resilient Families takes the guaranteed income model to new heights, with 600 families targeted for payments. The project, funded solely from philanthropic donations, has raised $6.75 million to date, of which it says at least 80% will be distributed. Who is eligible? To qualify for the Oakland Resilient Families payments, families must have at least one child under 18. Their income must be at or below the area’s median income: around $59,000 for a family of three. But half of the available spots will be reserved for very low-income families – those who earn below 138% of the federal poverty level – or, about $30,000 per year for a family of three. An online, multilingual screening form will be released later this spring and summer, after which families will be chosen at random to receive the payments. The program is also open to undocumented and/or unsheltered families. Because recipients will not be required to work for the payments, the money is not considered taxable income. Oakland Resilient Families will partner with local community organizations and government leaders to incorporate community feedback during the project’s rollout, intended to be fully operational by the summer."

    "content": "Mark Cuban is once again pushing the idea that every American household should receive $1,000 bi-weekly stimulus checks for the next two months. The billionaire investor says additional stimulus for Americans is just as paramount as it was at the start of the pandemic, claiming there are two economies, in which some are able to pay their bills and others cannot. Those without [help] are struggling badly, he told CNBC this week. We need to get them help. Cuban suggests a use or lose it approach where Americans would have to spend the funds within 10 days or they would lose the money. The approach is rooted in promoting spending to help stimulate the economy. The whole goal is to get that money every two weeks into the economy, Cuban said. Once businesses start having demand, even if they're closed and working online, then there is a reason for them to be able to bring back employees and retain those employees if demand is sustained. But with Congress in a stalemate, there are no signs that American households will be receiving a second wave of stimulus anytime soon. President Donald Trump urged the GOP to go higher in a tweet last Wednesday regarding a deal on coronavirus stimulus payments. But focus has since shifted as both Republicans and Democrats feud over who will fill the open Supreme Court seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Cuban joins the ranks of public figures who have called for providing more stimulus to Americans in the form of universal basic income, or UBI. The concept of universal basic income is a regular paycheck for all adult Americans, regardless of income and employment. Andrew Yang, helped popularize the UBI movement with his stand-out policy, the Freedom Dividend, during his stint as a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. Yang's proposal promised $1,000 a month or $12,000 a year for all US citizens over the age of 18. The idea was first piloted by Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, California, in February 2019. The project known as the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) provided Stockon residents with $500 a month for 18 months."

    "content": "Andrew Yang, 44, is participating on Thursday in the second Democratic presidential primary debate. Mr. Yang is a political neophyte and former tech executive with a devoted internet following known as the \"Yang Gang.\" As he has traveled across the country, running what he has called the \"nerdiest presidential campaign in history,\" he has unabashedly embraced his Taiwanese-American background. He believes that one way to help soften the impact of automation is through a universal basic income, which he has made a central part of his campaign. Mr. Yang has promised to give Americans $12,000 a year. Here’s a deeper look at his proposal. The context Mr. Yang wants the federal government to give each American adult a monthly check for $1,000, regardless of income or employment status. He has branded the payments the \"Freedom Dividend.\" Medicare and Medicaid would be unaffected under Mr. Yang’s plan, but people receiving government benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could choose to continue receiving those benefits, or take the $12,000 yearly payment instead. How he uses it As a relatively obscure candidate, Mr. Yang often acknowledges that the only thing people may know about him — if they have heard of him at all — is that he as \"an Asian man running for president who wants to give everyone $1,000 a month.\" His fans, known as the \"Yang Gang,\" have helped boost Mr. Yang’s popularity by turning him into a series of internet memes, which mostly revolve around free money. Obstacles Giving everyone $1,000 a month would come with a hefty price tag. Mr. Yang suggests paying for it in part by imposing a Value-Added Tax of 10 percent. But he would need the help of Congress to get any of this done. And although Mr. Yang thinks some Republicans would eventually buy into universal basic income, it's a near certainty that most would balk."

    "content": "One need not be a card-carrying revolutionary to deduce that global capitalism has a problem. In much of the world, angry workers denounce a shortage of jobs paying enough to support middle-class life. Economists puzzle over the fix for persistently weak wage growth, just as robots appear poised to replace millions of human workers. At the annual gathering of the global elite in the Swiss resort of Davos, billionaire finance chieftains debate how to make capitalism kinder to the masses to defuse populism. Enter the universal basic income. The idea is gaining traction in many countries as a proposal to soften the edges of capitalism. Though the details and philosophies vary from place to place, the general notion is that the government hands out regular checks to everyone, regardless of income or whether people are working. The money ensures food and shelter for all, while removing the stigma of public support. Some posit basic income as a way to let market forces work their ruthless magic, delivering innovation and economic growth, while laying down a cushion for those who fail. Others present it as a means of liberating people from wretched, poverty-level jobs, allowing workers to organize for better conditions or devote time to artistic exploits. Another school sees it as the required response to an era in which work can no longer be relied upon to finance basic needs. \"We see the increasing precariousness of employment,\" said Karl Widerquist, a philosopher at Georgetown University in Qatar, and a prominent advocate for a universal social safety net. \"Basic income gives the worker the power to say, ‘Well, if Walmart’s not going to pay me enough, then I’m just not going to work there.’ \" The universal basic income is clearly an idea with momentum. Early this year, Finland kicked off a two-year national experiment in basic income. In the United States, a trial was recently completed in Oakland, Calif., and another is about to launch in nearby Stockton, a community hard-hit by the Great Recession and the attendant epidemic in home foreclosures. The Canadian province of Ontario is enrolling participants for a basic income trial. Several cities in the Netherlands are exploring what happens when they hand out cash grants unconditionally to people already receiving some form of public support. A similar test is underway in Barcelona, Spain. A nonprofit organization, GiveDirectly, is proceeding with plans to provide universal cash grants in rural Kenya. As a concept, basic income has been kicked around in various guises for centuries, gaining adherents across a strikingly broad swath of the ideological spectrum, from the English social philosopher Thomas More to the American revolutionary Thomas Paine. The populist firebrand Louisiana governor Huey Long, the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., and the laissez faire economist Milton Friedman would presumably agree on little, yet all advocated some version of basic income. In a clear sign of its modern-day currency, the International Monetary Fund — not an institution prone to utopian dreaming — recently explored basic income as a potential salve for economic inequality. Not everyone loves the idea. Conservatives fret that handing out money free of obligation will turn people into dole-dependent slackers. In the American context, any talk of a truly universal form of basic income also collides with arithmetic. Give every American $10,000 a year — a sum still below the poverty line for an individual — and the tab runs to $3 trillion a year. That is about eight times what the United States now spends on social service programs. Labor-oriented economists in the United States are especially wary of basic income, given that the American social safety programs have been significantly trimmed in recent decades, with welfare, unemployment benefits and food stamps all subject to a variety of restrictions. If basic income were to replace these components as one giant program — the proposal that would appeal to libertarians — it might beckon as a fat target for additional budget trimming. \"Tens of millions of poor people would likely end up worse off,\" declared Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington-based research institution, in a recent blog post. \"Were we starting from scratch — and were our political culture more like Western Europe’s — U.B.I. might be a real possibility. But that’s not the world we live in.\" And some advocates for working people dismiss basic income as a wrongheaded approach to the real problem of not enough quality paychecks. \"People want to work,\" said the Nobel laureate economist Joseph E. Stiglitz when I asked him about basic income early this year. \"They don’t want handouts.\" Yet some of the basic income experiments now underway are engineered precisely to encourage people to work while limiting their contact with public assistance. Finland’s trial is giving jobless people the same amount of money they were already receiving in unemployment benefits, while relieving them of bureaucratic obligations. The bet is that people will use time now squandered submitting paperwork to train for better careers, start businesses, or take part-time jobs. Under the system the trial replaces, people living on benefits risk losing support if they secure other income. In short, basic income is being advanced not as a license for Finns to laze in the sauna, but as a means of enhancing the forces of creative destruction so central to capitalism. As the logic goes, once sustenance is eliminated as a worry, weak companies can be shuttered without concern for those thrown out of work, freeing up capital and talent for more productive ventures. The trials in the Netherlands, conducted at the municipal level, are similarly geared to paring bureaucracy from the unemployment system. Ditto, the Barcelona experiment. Silicon Valley has embraced basic income as a crucial element in enabling the continued rollout of automation. While engineers pioneer ways to replace human laborers with robots, financiers focus on basic income as a replacement for paychecks. The experiment in Stockton, Calif. — set to become the first city government to test basic income — is underwritten in part by an advocacy group known as the Economic Security Project, whose backers include the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. The trial is set to begin next year, with an undisclosed number of residents to receive $500 a month. The trial in Oakland was the work of Y Combinator, a start-up incubator. Its researchers handed out varying grants to a few dozen people as a simple feasibility test for basic income. The next phase is far more ambitious. The Y Combinator researchers plan to distribute grants to 3,000 people with below-average incomes in two as-yet undisclosed American states. They will hand out $1,000 a month to 1,000 people, no strings attached, and $50 a month to the rest, allowing for comparisons in how recipients use the money, and what impact it has on their lives. One key element of the basic income push is the assumption that poor people are better placed than bureaucrats to determine the most beneficial use of aid money. Rather than saddle recipients with complex rules and a dizzying array of programs, better to just give people money and let them sort out how to use it. This is a central idea of GiveDirectly’s program in Kenya, where it began a pilot study last year in which it handed out small, unconditional cash grants — about $22 a month — to residents of a single village. The program is now expanding its sights, with plans to hand out grants to some 16,000 people in 120 villages. From a research standpoint, these remain early days for basic income, a time for experimentation and assessment before serious amounts of money may be devoted to a new model for public assistance. Yet from a political standpoint, basic income appears to have found its moment, one delivered by the anxieties of the working poor combined with those of the wealthy, who see in widening inequality the potential for mobs wielding pitchforks. \"The interest is exploding everywhere,\" said Guy Standing, a research associate at SOAS University of London. \"The debates now are extraordinarily fertile.\""

    "content": "Why doesn’t the government just give everybody money? Figure out a reasonable amount — the official poverty line amounts to about $25,000 for a family of four; a full-time job at $15 an hour would provide about $30,000 a year — and hand every adult a monthly check. The minimum-wage worker stretching to make it to payday, the single mother balancing child care and a job — everybody would get the same thing. Poverty would be over, at a stroke. Being universal — that is, for the homeless and the masters of the universe alike — the program would be free of the cumbersome assessments required to determine eligibility. It would also escape the stigma typically attached to programs for the poor. And it would be politically secure. Programs for the poor are often maligned as poor programs. Indeed, defunding antipoverty programs rarely carries political consequences because the poor rarely vote. It’s another story entirely when everybody benefits. The idea of universal basic income sounds extravagant, right? Well, the Finns and even the Swiss are thinking about it. On Sunday, Swiss citizens will vote in a referendum on whether to hand out 30,000 francs a year — just over $30,000 — to every citizen, regardless of wealth, work status or whatever. In the United States, the idea has the support of thinkers on the left like Andrew Stern, former president of the Service Employees International Union. Some thinkers on the right, too, have managed to overcome their general distaste for government welfare to support the idea. This month, Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute will publish an updated version of his plan to replace welfare as we know it with a dollop of $10,000 in after-tax income for every American above the age of 21. Readers of my conversation with a fellow Times columnist, Farhad Manjoo, a few weeks ago know that I think the idea is, let’s say, poorly thought out. Given its resilience, however, it is worth taking apart more methodically. Its first hurdle is arithmetic. As Robert Greenstein of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities put it, a check of $10,000 to each of 300 million Americans would cost more than $3 trillion a year. Where would that money come from? It amounts to nearly all the tax revenue collected by the federal government. Nothing in the history of this country suggests Americans are ready to add that kind of burden to their current taxes. Cut it by half to $5,000? That wouldn’t even clear the poverty line. And it would still cost as much as the entire federal budget except for Social Security, Medicare, defense and interest payments. Thinkers on the right solve the how-to-pay-for-it problem simply by defunding everything else the government provides, programs as varied as food stamps and Social Security. That, Mr. Greenstein observes, would actually increase poverty. It would redistribute wealth upward, taking money targeted to the poor and sharing it with everybody, including you and me. As Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and onetime top economic adviser to President Obama, told me, paying a $5,000 universal basic income to the 250 million nonpoor Americans would cost about $1.25 trillion a year. \"It would be hard to finance that in a way that wouldn’t burden the programs that help the poor,\" he said. The popularity of the universal basic income stems from a fanciful diagnosis born in Silicon Valley of the challenges faced by the working class across industrialized nations: one that sees declining employment rates and stagnant wages and concludes that robots are about to take over all the jobs in the world. That might lie in our future — I will devote my next column to discussion of such a universe. But it’s certainly not our present. Men at their prime working ages, 25 to 54, have been falling out of the labor force since the 1960s. Still, today more than eight out of every 10 Americans in their prime are working. Work, as Lawrence Katz of Harvard once pointed out, is not just what people do for a living. It is a source of status. It organizes people’s lives. It offers an opportunity for progress. None of this can be replaced by a check. A universal basic income has many undesirable features, starting with its non-negligible disincentive to work. Almost a quarter of American households make less than $25,000. It would be hardly surprising if a $10,000 check each for mom and dad sapped their desire to work. A universal income divorces assistance from need. Aid is fixed, regardless of whatever else is going on. If our experience with block grants serves as precedent, it is most likely to become less generous over time. To libertarians this will sound more like a feature than a flaw, but replacing everything in the safety net with a check would limit the scope of government assistance in damaging ways. Say we know the choice of neighborhood makes a difference to the development of poor children. Housing vouchers might lead them to move into a better one. A monthly check would probably not. And those who think a universal benefit would be more politically resilient than a means-tested one might stop to ponder the unceasing chatter about trimming Social Security. It is undoubtedly true that the American safety net needs fixing. Fifty million Americans live in poverty. Sixteen million live on the equivalent of $8.60 a day. Providing more income security for the struggling working class would not only produce a more equitable society, it would also increase spending and improve economic growth. In this world, though, where work remains an important social, psychological and economic anchor, there are better tools to help than giving every American a monthly check. How about subsidized employment? The government could subsidize jobs as varied as school repairs and fixing potholes. \"This would provide employment while doing things that improve productivity and improve people’s lives,\" Mr. Greenstein said. Perhaps we could expand the earned-income tax credit, the country’s most successful antipoverty tool, which increases the earnings of low-income workers. Or take the idea pushed for years by Edmund Phelps from Columbia University: Instead of providing a subsidy to workers that phases out as their income rises, why not subsidize workers’ wages instead? As Mr. Summers told a gathering last week at the Brookings Institution, \"a universal basic income is one of those ideas that the longer you look at it, the less enthusiastic you become.\""

    "content": "Universal basic income is generating considerable interest these days, from Bernie Sanders, who says he is \"absolutely sympathetic\" to the idea, to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and other tech billionaires. The basic idea behind it is that handing out unconditional cash to all citizens, employed or not, would help reduce poverty and inequality, and increase individual liberty. This discussion is still largely theoretical, though, because universal basic income hasn’t been rigorously tested. Most experiments — in the United States in the 1970s; in the Dutch city of Utrecht today — have been local and based on small sample sizes. A nonprofit organization has run a larger program in Kenya. But that effort, which is aimed at decreasing poverty in a poor country, has little bearing for advanced economies and lacks the rigor of a state-mandated nationwide program. This is why eyes turned to Finland at the beginning of the year, when the government initiated a national test run for universal basic income. As a rich country in the European Union, with one of the highest rates of social spending in the world, Finland seemed like an ideal testing ground for a state-of-the-art social welfare experiment. In reality, the Finnish trial was poorly designed, and is little more than a publicity stunt. Kela, the national social-insurance institute, randomly selected 2,000 Finns between 25 and 58 years of age who were already getting some form of unemployment benefits. The subsidies were offered to people who had been unemployed for about one year or more, or who had less than six months of work experience. Participants in the trial would receive €560 (about $645) a month from January 2017 to December 2018, whether or not they came to earn any additional income. The trial size was cut to one-fifth of what had originally been proposed, and is now too small to be scientifically viable. Instead of giving free money to everyone, the experiment is handing out, in effect, a form of unconditional unemployment benefits. In other words, there is nothing universal about this version of universal basic income. And so even when the experiment’s official results are known, in 2019, they will reveal little — and far less than they could have — about the effects that universal cash payments could have on income inequality or people’s attitudes toward work and their quality of life. The shortcomings of Finland’s universal basic income experiment are best understood against the backdrop of the country’s lackluster economic performance and the resulting political developments. At the time of the 2015 parliamentary election, the Finnish labor market had experienced three recessions since the 2008 financial crisis. The public debt level increased from more than 38 percent of G.D.P. in 2008 to 75 percent in 2015. The Center Party, traditionally an agrarian party with broad support from rural areas, won the election on a conservative platform promoting public-debt reduction and tough reforms to boost the economy. The party leader, Juha Sipila, a wealthy former tech C.E.O., formed a government with the conservative National Coalition Party and the populist, nationalist Finns Party, based partly on their shared commitment to austerity. The Center Party’s manifesto called for reducing wages and raising the retirement age. It also briefly mentioned testing a system of universal basic income. Starting in the 1980s, Finnish progressives began discussing how distributing unconditional income might be a way to combat poverty and inequality resulting from declining employment in the industrial sector. The theory was that receiving a guaranteed income could free all citizens and allow groups like the jobless, students, stay-at-home parents and the elderly to meaningfully contribute to society through, say, caretaking, charity or artistic projects. But by the time Finland actually attempted the experiment, a conservative government committed to economic austerity was in power. How could it spearhead a leftist benefits program in the midst of economic hardship? It didn’t. The government has made no secret of the fact that its universal basic income experiment isn’t about liberating the poor or fighting inequality. Instead, the trial’s \"primary goal\" is \"promoting employment,\" the government explained in a 2016 document proposing the project to Parliament. Meaning: The project was always meant to incentivize people to accept low-paying and low-productivity jobs. At the same time that the government has begun testing a universal basic income, it has been tightening the requirements for receiving unemployment, disability and child care benefits. Yet according to a recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, replacing existing social support with a stingy, or even modest, universal basic income, as in Finland, may actually increase poverty rather than alleviate it. An article in The Economist last month quoted Olli Kangas, who helped design the Finnish program and coordinates it for Kela, complaining about the politicians’ lack of follow-through with the trial. He compared them to \"small boys with toy cars who become bored and move on.\" A second, expanded experiment was supposed to start in early 2018, but there are signs — like silence — that the government may renege on that plan. The universal basic income program in Finland is being whittled down before it even properly begins. So what can we learn from all of this so far? How not to conduct a trial of this kind. Universal basic income can only succeed if the effort is sustained and widespread — and not available only to the unemployed. The program should not be intended to force people into low-paying jobs. The Finnish government has a chance to correct its course. It should expand the trial in early 2018, as originally planned, and steer it back to its original ideals: a bold experiment to collect hard data about how a much-debated idea actually works in practice. Only that would honor Finland’s tradition of experimenting with innovative social policies."

    "content": "In October, Swiss voters submitted sufficient signatures to put an initiative on the ballot that would pay every citizen of Switzerland $2,800 per month, no strings attached. Similar efforts are under way throughout Europe. And there is growing talk of establishing a basic income for Americans as well. Interestingly, support comes mainly from those on the political right, including libertarians. The recent debate was kicked off in an April 30, 2012, post, by Jessica M. Flanigan of the University of Richmond, who said all libertarians should support a universal basic income on the grounds of social justice. Professor Flanigan, a self-described anarchist, opposes a system of property rights \"that causes innocent people to starve.\" She cited a paper by the philosopher Matt Zwolinski of the University of San Diego in the December 2011 issue of the journal Basic Income Studies, which also contained other papers by libertarians supporting the basic income concept. While acknowledging that most libertarians would reject explicit redistribution of income, he pointed to several libertarians, including the economists F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman, who favored the idea of a basic universal income. Friedman’s argument appeared in his 1962 book, \"Capitalism and Freedom,\" based on lectures given in 1956, and was called a negative income tax. His view was that the concept of progressivity ought to work in both directions and would be based on the existing tax code. Thus if the standard deduction and personal exemption exceeded one’s gross income, one would receive a subsidy equal to what would have been paid if one had comparable positive taxable income. In 1965, Sargent Shriver, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, recommended to President Lyndon Johnson that he support Friedman’s idea of a negative income tax. Friedman provided illustrative figures to The New York Times showing how his plan would work. The maximum benefit would be $1,500 per year for someone with zero gross income, which would be about $11,500 in today’s dollars. Ultimately, Johnson rejected the negative income tax but appointed a commission that later recommended one. Johnson also supported an experiment by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare that would run small pilot negative income tax programs in various cities and states to see how people responded. The negative income tax was revived by President Richard Nixon in an August 1969 proposal called the family assistance plan that had been developed by Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The New York Times columnist James Reston called it a \"remarkably progressive welfare policy.\" Ironically, it was liberals who killed the Nixon effort, because they didn’t believe it was liberal enough. Although many conservatives also opposed the Nixon plan, enough Republicans supported it to have been successful if the bulk of congressional liberals also supported it. Although the family assistance plan passed the House of Representatives in April 1970, it eventually died in the Senate Finance Committee, where both liberals and conservatives opposed it. In 1978, the negative income tax received a critical blow when reports from the government experiments came in and showed that the impact on work effort was more severe than had been anticipated, with work hours by those receiving government grants falling sharply. Mr. Moynihan, by then a United States senator from New York, was forced to admit failure. Nevertheless, the following year, the economist F.A. Hayek endorsed a universal basic income in Volume 3 of his book, \"Law, Legislation and Liberty\": The assurance of a certain minimum income for everyone, or a sort of floor below which nobody need fall even when he is unable to provide for himself, appears not only to be a wholly legitimate protection against a risk common to all, but a necessary part of the Great Society in which the individual no longer has specific claims on the members of the particular small group into which he was born. In 2006, the conservative scholar Charles Murray published \"In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State,\" which advocated a universal grant of $10,000 per year in lieu of the existing welfare system, including Social Security and Medicare. Most recently, Matthew Feeney of Reason, the libertarian magazine, wrote favorably about the Swiss proposal in a Nov. 26 post. As a complete replacement for the existing welfare system, he thought it had merit and might even save money. He was especially critical of the paternalism of the current welfare system and the denial of autonomy to those living in poverty. \"Instead of treating those who, often through no fault of their own, have fallen on hard times, like children who are incapable of making the right choices about the food they eat or the drugs they may or may not choose to take, why not just give them cash?\" Mr. Feeney asked. Feeney cited Thomas Paine in support of his proposal. In Paine’s 1797 pamphlet, \"Agrarian Justice,\" he advocated a social insurance system for young and old, financed by a 10 percent tax on inherited property. Paine would have given everyone 15 pounds at age 21 and 10 pounds per year to everyone at least age 50 for life. These are significant sums. It is difficult to calculate, but with the Measuring Worth calculator, 15 pounds in 1797 would be equivalent to approximately $17,500 today. One purpose of giving young people a grant was in compensation for the loss of their natural inheritance in land, which had been seized by the state and given or sold to particular individuals for their exclusive use. The libertarian economist David Friedman, son of Milton Friedman, and Professor Zwolinski, the philosopher, have both expressed sympathy for Paine’s idea that everyone today suffers from past injustices in terms of property rights. A universal income might be an appropriate reparations payment, they say. Of course, not all libertarians agree with this recent interest in a guaranteed income. The Bloomberg columnist Megan McArdle notes the earlier problems with work effort identified in the negative income tax experiments. She also questions how immigrants would be treated and how politicians would react to stories about people blowing their checks on cigarettes and booze. These are valid concerns. But it is worth remembering that we already have considerable experience with the basic income payment in Alaska. Since 1976, it has had a permanent fund to collect revenues from oil production and invest them, paying out an annual dividend to all state residents."

    "content": "This town in California’s Central Valley has long functioned as a display case for wrenching troubles afflicting American life: The housing bust that turned Stockton into an epicenter of a national foreclosure disaster and plunged the city into bankruptcy. The homeless people clustered in tents along the railroad tracks. Boarded-up storefronts on cracked sidewalks. Gang violence. Now, Stockton hopes to make itself an exhibition ground for elevated fortunes through a simple yet unorthodox experiment. It is readying plans to deliver $500 a month in donated cash to perhaps 100 local families, no strings attached. The trial could start as soon as the fall and continue for about two years. As the first American city to test so-called universal basic income, Stockton will watch what happens next. So will governments and social scientists around the world as they explore how to share the bounty of capitalism more broadly at a time of rising economic inequality. Will single mothers use their cash to pay for child care so they can attend college? Will people confronting choices between buying school supplies or paying their electric bills gain a measure of security? Will families add healthier food to their diets? Basic income is a term that gets thrown around loosely, but the gist is that the government distributes cash universally. As the logic runs, if everyone gets money — rich and poor, the employed and the jobless — it removes the stigma of traditional welfare schemes while ensuring sustenance for all. That a city in California has made itself a venue for the idea seems no accident. The state has long tried fresh approaches to governance. Ahead of the state’s political primaries in June, much of the conversation has centered on concerns about economic inequality. The concept of basic income has been gaining adherents from Europe to Africa to North America as a potential stabilizer in the face of a populist insurrection tearing at the post-World War II liberal economic order. It is being embraced by social thinkers seeking to reimagine capitalism to more justly distribute its gains, and by technologists concerned about the job-destroying power of their creations. In various guises, the idea has captivated activists and intellectuals for centuries. In the 1500s, Thomas More’s novel \"Utopia\" advanced the suggestion that thieves would be better deterred by public assistance than fear of a death sentence. In more modern times, Milton Friedman, darling of laissez-faire economics, embraced the idea of negative income taxes that put cash in the hands of the poorest people. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. advocated \"the guaranteed income.\" Dr. King’s legacy has currency in Stockton, which is now led by a history-making mayor, Michael Tubbs. At 27, he is the youngest mayor of a sizable American city, and the first African-American to hold the job here. Mr. Tubbs grew up in South Stockton, where payday lenders and pawn shops exploit the desperation of working poor people. His father was in prison for gang-related crime. His mother worked in medical customer service and struggled to pay bills, relying on welfare and food stamps. His mother kept him inside, his nose in his school books, fearful of the pitfalls beyond the door. He recalls standing at the mailbox tearing open a college acceptance letter while police cars massed down the block, lights flashing, as a neighbor’s son was arrested for dealing drugs. Many of the adults around him were juggling multiple jobs, yet still living under the tyranny of unpaid bills. \"People were working themselves to death,\" Mr. Tubbs said. \"Not working to live a good life, but working just to survive.\" He enrolled at Stanford University. In his high school yearbook, friends scribbled congratulations for his having \"made it from here.\" He was an intern in President Barack Obama’s White House. After graduating from college in 2012, he taught ethnic studies, government and society at a charter high school while serving on the Stockton City Council. On the same day that President Trump was elected, voters in this city of 300,000 people put Mr. Tubbs in charge. Working but Struggling Forged as a supply hub during the Gold Rush of the 19th century, Stockton evolved into a center for migrant workers who toil in the fruit and vegetable farms of California’s Central Valley. By the new millennium, it had become a bedroom community offering affordable homes for people who worked in unaffordable places like San Francisco and Silicon Valley, as far as two hours away. The crash in housing prices played out savagely here. The local unemployment rate reached 19 percent in early 2011. Stockton descended into bankruptcy. As Mr. Tubbs took office, nearly one in four local residents was officially poor. The median household income was about $46,000 — roughly one-fourth below the national level. Only 17 percent of adults 25 and older had graduated from college. People were perpetually vulnerable to mundane calamities like auto troubles that kept them from getting to work. \"Poverty is the biggest issue,\" the mayor said. \"Everything we deal with stems from that. There’s so many people working incredibly hard, and if life happens, there’s no bottom.\" Once he took office, his staff recommended basic income as a potential means of attacking poverty, one that was starting to gain traction around the world. In contrast to government programs that stipulate how money must be spent, basic income is supposed to deliver regular payments without restrictions. It amounts to a bet that poor people know the most appropriate use for a dollar better than bureaucrats. Rather than filling out forms and waiting to see case workers, people can devote their effort to looking for work, gaining skills or spending time with their children. On the other side of the world, Finland was starting a pilot project. Just down the freeway in Oakland, the start-up incubator, Y Combinator, was conducting a trial. The Canadian province of Ontario was preparing for an experiment. A nonprofit organization, GiveDirectly, was giving cash grants to poor people in rural Kenya. All of these trials confronted various forms of skepticism, bringing warnings that unconditional cash would replace paychecks with the dole. Finland recently opted not to expand its basic income experiment. In the United States, a program supplying $10,000 a year to every American would cost $3 trillion. Even some proponents of expanding the social safety net oppose the idea, fearing it would siphon money away from existing programs. Still, as the traditional promise of work breaks down, unconventional ideas are emerging from the political margins to gain a serious airing. At a conference in San Francisco last spring, Mr. Tubbs was introduced to Natalie Foster, a co-founder of the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group formed to advance the concept of universal basic income. The project included Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder. Within the Silicon Valley crowd, basic income had become a fashionable idea for addressing collective angst over the social consequences of technology. The masters of innovation were becoming stupendously rich via creations poised to make working people poor, replacing human labor with robots. Basic income was posited as compensation. The Economic Security Project was keen to demonstrate another aspect of basic income — its potential to help communities facing problems in the here and now. It was shopping for a city that could serve as staging ground. \"It’s important that people see this as possible,\" Ms. Foster said. \"Cities are laboratories of democracy.\" Stockton was diverse, with more than 40 percent of its residents Hispanic, some 20 percent Asian, and 14 percent African-American. More than half of the working-age people in surrounding San Joaquin County earned the minimum wage. The city was in the hands of a social media-savvy mayor who could help spread the word. Ms. Foster’s group agreed to deliver $1 million for a new project — SEED, for Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration. The sum was nowhere near enough to finance universal anything. It would not cover the basics of any critical need. Still, it could produce a glimpse of what a guaranteed cash program might look like. The city commissioned artists to paint murals in the center of town, celebrating basic income as the next phase of the civil rights struggle advanced by Dr. King. Who Deserves A Hand? As city leaders formulate the details of the project, they are wrestling with a foundational question: Are they running a legitimate social science experiment, or engineering a demonstration of basic income’s virtues? The answer directs how they distribute the cash. If it is primarily a display, then only the most responsible people should be given cash. But if it is about science, the money must be dispensed more randomly, with the likelihood that some people will waste it on drugs. At a meeting at City Hall, the SEED project manager Lori Ospina urged that the program be designed to yield valid scientific data. That involves choosing participants on the basis of narrow demographic criteria — perhaps their age, their race, their income. But that approach could expose the city to charges that the program is not inclusive enough. \"The trolls I’ve been dealing with on social media and in real life have very racialized views of how this is going to work,\" Mr. Tubbs said. \"As the first black mayor of this city, it would be very dangerous if the only people to get this were black.\" He wants to select participants who are most likely to spend their money wisely, generating stories of working poor people lifted by extra cash. People like Shay Holliman. As a child, her mother was incarcerated. She was raised by her grandmother, along with nine other children. They crammed into apartments full of cockroaches, moving from state to state to stay ahead of the bill collectors. She had a baby. She worked at McDonald’s, but she lacked reliable child care, making the job impossible. She could not pay rent on her $600 a month welfare check. One night, she found herself walking the Stockton streets, her infant daughter in a carrier against her chest, pulling two suitcases full of everything she owned. Taking shelter with a sister consumed by drug addiction, she fell into a vortex of violence. She served 11 years in prison for killing a man who she said had attacked her sister. She emerged with a problem that confronts many people in Stockton: She was eager to work, yet she was vulnerable to criminal background checks that deny jobs to convicted felons. She worked inside commercial freezers and as a driver. Recently, she took a job at a nonprofit that helps people released from prison set up lives on the outside. \"I’m finally living my dream,\" she said. In some quarters, the basic income experiment has provoked talk that free money will prompt people to ditch work. \"Oh, my,\" said Ms. Holliman, who still carries credit card debt of more than $500 and does not earn enough money to regularly buy fresh fruit. \"When you’re struggling, you’re going to rush and pay your bills.\" Stockton’s trial is meant to deliver examples of that sentiment, challenging the notion that people needing help have not tried hard enough. \"It’s about changing the narrative around who’s deserving,\" the mayor said.

    "content": "For more than a year, Finland has been testing the proposition that the best way to lift economic fortunes may be the simplest: Hand out money without rules or restrictions on how people use it. The experiment with so-called universal basic income has captured global attention as a potentially promising way to restore economic security at a time of worry about inequality and automation. Now, the experiment is ending. The Finnish government has opted not to continue financing it past this year, a reflection of public discomfort with the idea of dispensing government largess free of requirements that its recipients seek work. Finland has actually reversed course on that front this year, adopting rules that threaten to cut benefits for jobless people unless they actively look for work or engage in job training. \"It’s a pity that it will end like this,\" said Olli Kangas, who oversees research at Kela, a Finnish government agency that administers many social welfare programs and has played a leading role in the basic-income experiment. \"The government has chosen to try a totally different path. Basic income is unconditional. Now, they are pursuing conditionality.\" The demise of the project in Finland does not signal an end of interest in the idea. Other trials are underway or being explored in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Canadian province of Ontario, the Netherlands and Kenya. In much of the world, the concept of basic income retains appeal as a potential way to more justly spread the bounty of global capitalism while cushioning workers against the threat of robots and artificial intelligence taking their jobs. But the Finnish government’s decision to halt the experiment at the end of 2018 highlights a challenge to basic income’s very conception. Many people in Finland — and in other lands — chafe at the idea of handing out cash without requiring that people work. \"There is a problem with young people lacking secondary education, and reports of those guys not seeking work,\" said Heikki Hiilamo, a professor of social policy at the University of Helsinki. \"There is a fear that with basic income they would just stay at home and play computer games.\" For centuries, thinkers across the ideological spectrum have embraced the notion of basic income. It has gained favor with the social philosopher Thomas More, the laissez faire economist Milton Friedman and the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., an unusual diversity of support that has enhanced the appeal of the idea as a modern-day solution to economic anxiety in much of the world. Silicon Valley technologists have suggested that basic income could enable humanity to exploit the labor-saving promise of robots absent the fear of mass joblessness. Labor advocates have focused on basic income as a means of increasing bargaining power among workers, limiting the pressure for people to accept poverty wages at dead-end jobs. Other people have advanced basic income as a way of enabling parents to spend more time with their children. Finland’s goals have been modest and pragmatic. The government hoped that basic income would send more people into the job market to revive a weak economy. Under Finland’s traditional unemployment program, those lacking jobs are effectively discouraged from accepting temporary positions or starting businesses, because extra income risks the loss of their benefits. The basic income trial, which started at the beginning of 2017 and will continue until the end of this year, has given monthly stipends of 560 euros ($685) to a random sample of 2,000 unemployed people aged 25 to 58. Recipients have been free to do as they wished — create start-ups, pursue alternate jobs, take classes — secure in the knowledge that the stipends would continue regardless. The Finnish government was keen to see what people would do under such circumstances. The data is expected to be released next year, giving academics a chance to analyze what has come of the experiment. In the meantime, Finland has already moved on to consider a broader revamping of its social service programs. It is studying a new form of social welfare policy now in effect in Britain: so-called universal credit, which rolls existing government aid programs into one monthly lump sum payment. \"The social security system is fragmented and has a lot of bureaucracy,\" said Liisa Heinamaki,who is overseeing a project exploring ways to reorganize that system. \"Discussion about basic income is not over, but it is a part of the larger discussion now.\" In Britain, the shift to universal credit has poor people reeling, depriving many of them of government support while their cases shift from the old system. Benefits have increased for some people, but many recipients have wound up with less. In Finland, where the social safety net is famously generous, a structure like Britain’s could yield the very thing basic income is supposed to deliver: a guarantee that every member of society can be assured of sustenance and shelter. This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant. Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth. \"In a sense,\" said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, \"Finland already has basic income.\""

    "content": "Last winter, a Detroit woman seeking financial stability walked into a local job-readiness center, supported by a national community development nonprofit called LISC. She enrolled in an eight-week job-preparedness program that taught her the skills needed to land an apprenticeship in the building trades. Seven months, four certifications and a union card later, the woman, Tiffany, is working full-time — with benefits — as a millwright apprentice, installing and repairing factory machinery. She finds the work fulfilling and is up for a raise in a few months. The need to help people like Tiffany, who did not want her last name used, will grow only more acute: Job dislocation and wage pressure caused by rapid technological development and globalization are likely to persist for a long time. These forces can contribute powerfully to productivity and growth, but they have worsened problems in our economy, from stagnant wages to the lack of opportunities for those with less education. Too many people lack access to entry-level jobs with good wages, especially in industries like manufacturing, where activity is actually near a high. The reason is that technology has enabled this work to be done by far fewer employees — or it’s not being done at all, because workers don’t have the specialized skills certain jobs demand. That’s where a robust federal jobs program could help. Millions of Americans could work in high-need areas rebuilding and repairing crumbling roads and bridges or taking care of the elderly. The jobs should pay a living wage (even during the training phase), come with good benefits and be widely available, including to the formerly incarcerated. The program could include both public jobs and subsidized private employment, either temporary or longer-term. The jobs would provide credentials and hard and soft skills through on-the-job training, which could then facilitate a transition into unsubsidized private-sector employment. We should also invest in more vocational training and apprenticeships, like the one Tiffany landed. Though public jobs programs are associated with Democrats, Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Trump administration’s Council of Economic Advisers, recently backed the idea, creating the possibility of bipartisan support. Public employment should be viewed not as a social program but as a public investment with a high rate of return. The return is increased economic output, coupled with the development of human capital — which increases productivity and the size of the effective labor force — in a population and economy that badly need it. That human capital, in turn, could catalyze more business investment and activity in low-income neighborhoods, which would further promote economic growth. But instead of embracing a large-scale federal jobs program, some people — especially in Silicon Valley — have rallied behind a different policy response to job and wage pressures created by artificial intelligence, robotics and other forces: the universal basic income. The basic income would provide a sizable government payment, meant to support a minimum standard of living, to every American regardless of economic status. Instead of helping Tiffany find work as a millwright, the government would just write her a check. The universal basic income wouldn’t help people upgrade skills and be more successful in the labor market, or generate useful economic output, or give them the sense of purpose and dignity that comes from work. Public employment, however, would provide these social and economic benefits — and a paycheck. People like Tiffany want to be productive members of the work force and have opportunities for advancement. The basic income is defeatist — the solution to our jobs problem is not to give up on equipping workers with the skills they need for a changing economy. Instead, a federal jobs program would provide people with work that is both personally meaningful and economically beneficial. And there’s also the issue of the basic income’s huge cost. The poverty expert Robert Greenstein has shown that the universal basic income would carry an annual cost in the trillions of dollars. Given our country’s fiscal conditions, the jobs program should be paid for — and not with fanciful growth claims some use to justify tax cuts. I’m convinced that a program of this nature would have multiple beneficial effects for our economy that would far outweigh its cost, including strengthening our tattered social fabric. If we don’t put in place a constructive response to wage and job pressures, we could face ever-greater difficulty attracting public support for sound economic policy. While we pursue public employment, we must also help those who can’t work because of health or family circumstances, by, for example, extending the child-tax credit to the poorest children. And we should protect other programs that support low-income people or prepare them for the work force, such as Medicaid, food stamps, job training, child care and the earned-income tax credit. The federal jobs program I’ve described doesn’t have the intuitive simplicity of the universal basic income. But it serves critical purposes that the basic income doesn’t and should be an integral part of a broad-based agenda to address rapidly changing economic conditions. Adopting a federal jobs program could enhance our work force and increase our nation’s output while providing people with the self-worth and economic opportunity that work can provide."

    "content": "In the national consciousness, Stockton has had a run of bad associations. It suffered as an epicenter of the foreclosure crisis, and was a prime exhibit of how a city can plunge into bankruptcy. Now Stockton is becoming a laboratory for an idea capturing attention worldwide as a potential means of making life more economically secure for all. It is readying plans to begin a trial of so-called Universal Basic Income, handing out cash grants to several hundred local families, no strings attached. Finland has tested the idea. Trials have been underway in Oakland and in Canada. But Stockton is set to become the first American city to embrace the idea from City Hall itself. That a city in California has made itself a venue for the idea seems no accident. The state has long tried fresh approaches to governance. Ahead of the state’s political primaries on Tuesday, much of the conversation has centered on concerns about economic inequality. The project in Stockton is the product of a partnership between the city’s history-making, social-media savvy mayor, Michael Tubbs, and a philanthropic foundation headed by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Silicon Valley has taken a shine to basic income as a way to soften the effects of its creations — a potential army of robots poised to capture jobs from humans. But Stockton wants to demonstrate a different aspect of basic income’s appeal: its potential to alleviate the troubles of the working poor. The idea is that single mothers might use cash to go back to school, while poor families add fruit and vegetables to their diets. Basic income confronts potent skepticism. Some argue it will undermine the work ethic. Others contend that it will compete with — and siphon funding from — existing government relief programs for the poor and jobless. A national program could cost trillions of dollars a year. But the Stockton trial is engineered as an test of how an unconditional cash grant program can operate. Which means that a Central Valley City that has long represented scarcity will now be used to convey how life can change when struggling people get a little more. • \"It seems Trump’s endorsement put Cox over the top.\" A new poll shows the Republican John Cox with a seven-point advantage for second place in the governor’s primary race, meaning he could face Lt.

    "content": "Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, on Monday said what many in her caucus have been saying for weeks: A guaranteed income to help Americans struggling because of the coronavirus pandemic is \"worthy of attention.\" As recently as just a few months ago, an income guarantee was widely written off as unrealistic. But two-thirds of the members of the House Democratic caucus now support the idea of some kind of cash payment that would continue until the end of the crisis. The pandemic may have precipitated this change of heart, but the pandemic alone isn’t why we need a guaranteed income. The American economy is plagued by instability and fragility, much of it caused by staggering levels of inequality. If we want to create a more resilient economy and country, a guaranteed income should be permanent American policy, not just an emergency measure to help with this crisis. Over the past several decades, legislators and policymakers of both political parties, obsessed with economic \"efficiency,\" lowered taxes and reduced regulation on the assumption that those policies would create a healthier economy and a better society. They spoke of a \"free market,\" with rules that were supposedly impartial and fair, even though political power has always shaped markets to reward some and harm others. We have ended up with an economy that is not only unjust but also stunted in its growth and more fragile than before. The coronavirus crisis has heightened and made more vivid what was already clear to many: The unfairness of our economy is a matter of life and death for millions of Americans. The United States needs a new economic framework designed for resiliency in the face of disruption and change. A guaranteed income — one that would provide $1,000 for every adult and $500 per child per month — should be its centerpiece. Some advocates of a guaranteed income, often calling it a universal basic income, or U.B.I., argue that the policy is required to address the problem of large-scale unemployment caused by job-killing artificial intelligence. But the reason we need a guaranteed income isn’t technological progress; it’s the fundamental precariousness and injustice of today’s economy. The coronavirus has reminded us how inequality can kill. Poorer Americans, who are more likely to work in jobs that expose them to the virus and less likely to have access to health care, have disproportionately fallen ill and died. And it’s not just the poor who are suffering. Middle-class workers have also been poorly set up to weather a storm of this magnitude. Policymakers’ failure to adequately regulate and provide affordable housing, health care and education has caused the cost of living to skyrocket while incomes have stagnated. The pandemic has also exposed how many Americans teeter close to the brink financially. This is why government can’t be relegated to providing just a \"safety net\" for people who find themselves on the losing end of otherwise fair markets. The markets themselves are structured to provide short-term profits for some, rather than long-term resiliency for many. Organizing markets around resiliency instead of profit means ensuring that workers are better protected from unpredictability. Workers should be able to share in the economic fortune created in the good times and to rely on a guaranteed income that gives them access to basic affordable goods in the bad times. Direct cash payments are a highly effective way to provide financial stability to families. Cash moves quickly and reliably, which is particularly important in times of emergency. (Even with the problems the Treasury Department has experienced in distributing stimulus payments, 130 million American households have already received payments from the government, most over $1,000.) The data on how people are spending their coronavirus stimulus checks demonstrate the flexibility that direct cash offers families. Some households use the money for basics — groceries, medicine, rent, child care — while others might use it to buy a laptop for a child now doing distance learning. Restricted benefits like food or rent vouchers, while critically important, can end up merely shifting cash from one budget line to another. Direct cash payments, by contrast, give each family the discretion to spend the money as its needs. The Economic Security Project, an organization I co-founded about four years ago, has been working alongside groups like the Urban Institute and the Roosevelt Institute to map out exactly how a guaranteed income might work. But these days we’re hardly the only ones giving the matter thought. Dozens of Democratic politicians, led by Senators Kamala Harris, Sherrod Brown, Cory Booker and Michael Bennet, and Representatives Ro Khanna, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal and Tim Ryan, are calling for the creation of an income floor — either temporarily for this crisis or permanently. Proposals vary, but a consensus is emerging that every American adult in a family making less than $100,000 should get at least $1,000 a month, and each child in these families should get $500 a month. A family of four would receive $3,000 a month or $36,000 a year. Some proposals provide more for children, and others distribute the funds to all Americans, regardless of how much money a family makes. The details matter, but the shared commitment to some sort of guaranteed income matters more. A guaranteed income would not, of course, solve the problem of economic insecurity all by itself. Such a policy would have to be administered alongside programs like expanded unemployment insurance, Social Security payments and SNAP food benefits. The overlap in these programs would be a feature, not a bug, of a resiliency agenda. We can no longer believe the false promises of an economic orthodoxy that insists there is a trade-off between growth and fairness. If anything, research suggests that the opposite is true: Equality helps drive growth. Many things that improve Americans’ lives, such as public investment to combat climate change and laws that rein in corporate power, will also be critical to growing our economy. In the next several weeks, legislators in Washington will decide whether to include additional cash payments in the next stimulus package. Given the growing ranks of Democrats who support the idea, as well as the support of some Republicans, including in the White House, regular cash payments through the end of the crisis could become a reality. A permanent guaranteed income, however, is unlikely to happen with Donald Trump as the president and Mitch McConnell as the majority leader in the Senate. Democrats should make resiliency the animating idea behind this year’s presidential campaign, with a guaranteed income at its center. If they win in the fall, they will have a clear mandate for a resiliency agenda and a guaranteed income when the country, by all accounts, will still be reeling from the ravages of the pandemic. The coronavirus crisis has created staggering levels of suffering. Let it be a reason we commit to a more moral and just structure for our economy, one that ensures all Americans are better prepared for adversity in the future."

    "content": "In San Francisco, public officials have announced a pilot program that will provide a monthly stipend to artists. The mayor’s office recently unveiled the initiative, city payments that were approved by the  arts commission, which will provide a guaranteed monthly income of $1,000 over six months to 130 eligible artists. A similar experiment started in St. Paul, Minn., this week. There, a nonprofit organization is working with the city to disburse monthly $500 checks to 25 local artists for the next 18 months. Springboard for the Arts, the organization running the initiative, with funding from two foundations, said it hoped a successful program could change the national conversation. And more programs, not limited to arts workers, are springing up in cities like Oakland, Calif., and Atlanta, whose leaders are part of a 41-member coalition, Mayors for a Guaranteed Income. The coalition says that providing such an income will improve racial and gender equity. (New York has no such plan in the works, a spokesman for the Department of Cultural Affairs said last week.) Interest in guaranteed income — or universal basic income — has built over the last year as a potential solution to the lopsided economic effects of the pandemic. \"We knew this health crisis would impact artists, and artists of color in particular,\" San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, said in a statement. \"If we help the arts recover, the arts will help San Francisco recover.\" San Francisco has other such programs — one that provides payments to San Franciscans training as emergency medical technicians, and another that’s part of a $60 million initiative to invest in Black children and families. Since opening the application portal for artists on March 25, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, which is administering the guaranteed income program on behalf of San Francisco, said it has received more than 1,800 responses. (The deadline for applications is April 15.) Deborah Cullinan, the organization’s chief executive, said that if people in the arts are unstable, \"to my mind, I think it means that we are not stable. An organization is only as stable as its core community.\" Cullinan said that she hoped that data from the program could be used to inform the national agenda, and that she already had interest from the federal government. \"It’s about finding new and innovative ways to address the economic insecurity of our sector,\" Cullinan added. In St. Paul, the McKnight and Bush Foundations have helped get the guaranteed-income program off the ground. Laura Zabel, Springboard’s director overseeing the project, said that the monthly payments would help artists afford food and rent. The recipients of the stipends will be chosen from a pool of previous recipients of the organization’s coronavirus emergency grants. The director added that at least 75 percent of recipients would be people of color."

    "title": "Guaranteed Income for All? Switzerland’s Voters Say No Thanks",
    "source": "The New York Times",

    "URL": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/06/world/europe/switzerland-swiss-vote-basic-income.html?searchResultPosition=24",
    "content": "GENEVA — Swiss voters on Sunday overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to guarantee an income to Switzerland’s residents, whether or not they are employed, an idea that has also been raised in other countries amid an intensifying debate over wealth disparities and dwindling employment opportunities. About 77 percent of voters rejected a plan to give a basic monthly income of 2,500 Swiss francs, or about $2,560, to each adult, and 625 francs for each child under 18, regardless of employment status, to fight poverty and social inequality and guarantee a \"dignified\" life to everyone. Switzerland was the first country to vote on such a universal basic income plan, but other countries and cities either have been considering the idea or have started trial programs. Finland is set to introduce a pilot program for a random sample of about 10,000 adults who will each receive a monthly handout of 550 euros, about $625. The intent is to turn the two-year trial into a national plan if it proves successful. In the Netherlands, Utrecht is leading a group of municipalities that are experimenting with similar pilot projects. In the United States, the idea of a guaranteed income has gained some traction in the run-up to the presidential election in November. It has been promoted by some Democrats who are demanding more social justice, but it also has some right-wing advocates who see it as a better alternative to government welfare programs. In Switzerland, opponents warned that the proposal would derail an economic model that, far from showing signs of near-collapse, has allowed the country to remain among those with the highest living standards in the world, even with a growing and aging population. Switzerland has an unemployment rate of around 3.5 percent, less than half the average in the European Union. The backers of the plan did not detail how it would be financed. But the Swiss government and almost all the main political parties had urged voters to turn down the guaranteed income plan, warning that it would require raising an additional 25 billion Swiss francs a year through deep spending cuts or tax increases. Some opponents of a Swiss guaranteed income also attacked it as a return to Marxist economics, even if the idea has far older roots, dating to the 16th-century writings of Thomas More and the 18th-century works of Thomas Paine. After World War II, the concept of a guaranteed income was promoted as a way of redistributing income by some free-market economists led by Milton Friedman, who in part argued that it would be more efficient than the bureaucracy of running dozens of separate programs to help the poor. Still, the current discussion, in Switzerland and elsewhere, has been not only about wealth redistribution but also about how modern societies can continue to create jobs while pushing technological advances such as factory robots and driverless trucks. Campaigners in favor of a guaranteed income used robots as street stunts to warn what the jobless society of the future would entail. Some people gave out 10-franc notes at the Zurich’s main train station while supporters in Geneva set up, on a public esplanade, a giant banner that asked, \"What would you do if your income were taken care of?\" \"I understand that a new generation is worried about how and where young people will next find work, but this proposal was pure nonsense,\" said Curdin Pirovino, a Swiss industrial designer. \"You cannot give a society the idea that money is available for doing nothing.\" But at a Sunday market in Geneva, several people defended the proposal in the context of returning to a more equitable society. Some also presented their vote as another challenge to industrialization, similar to their motivation for buying organic food from the stalls of local farmers rather than cheaper supermarkets. A third of voters in Geneva backed the idea of a guaranteed income. \"We’re losing all our values, creating countries that no longer need workers but still need consumers, but how can we expect people to buy anything if they can’t earn a salary tomorrow?\" asked Olivier Duchene, a musician and street entertainer. Despite the clear defeat, campaigners said the vote was a first step toward a fairer economic model. \"One out of five people voted for the unconditional basic income, so that is a success in itself,\" Sergio Rossi, an economics professor who backed the initiative, told STA, the Swiss news agency. Switzerland’s model of direct democracy, in which citizens can collect signatures to force a national referendum on a proposal, has helped turn the country into a laboratory for pioneering social and economic changes. In early 2013, the Swiss voted to impose some of the world’s most severe restrictions on executive compensation, following a proposal by a small entrepreneur in defiance of the country’s big business lobby. Later that year, however, the Swiss rejected another economic proposal, the \"1:12\" initiative, which would have limited the salary of top executives to 12 times the wages of their lowest-paid employees. And in 2014, the Swiss rejected a proposal to introduce what would have been the world’s highest minimum wage, equivalent to nearly $25 an hour. Referendums are gaining ground in other European countries that normally rely on a system of parliamentary democracy. Last year, Greece held a referendum on a bailout plan, and the Netherlands introduced a referendum law under which voters rejected a European Union agreement with Ukraine in April. Britain is set to vote in a referendum this month on whether to leave the European Union a year after Scotland voted to stay in the United Kingdom. But in Switzerland, the proliferation of such votes has provoked a debate over the ease with which complicated or radical issues can be brought to a referendum. Low voter turnout has also become an issue. About 46 percent of eligible Swiss voters went to the polls on Sunday, when four other national issues and several regional issues were voted on. Philippe Leuba, a regional politician, said on Swiss national radio on Sunday that it was positive that voters had followed the advice of their federal government. But he still deplored the fact that the proposal for guaranteed income had gotten so far, calling it a \"hyper-populist and demagogic\" plan to give away money for nothing."

    "title": "Cash payments spread from Congress to Stockton to Brazil — but notion of ‘universal basic income’ far from reality",
    "source": "Washington Post",
    "author": "Eli Rosenberg",
    "URL": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/22/guaranteed-income-ubi-stockton-congress-aid/",
    "content": "hen this Central Valley city of 300,000, far removed from the wealth and coastal vibes of the Bay Area, became the first in the country to try out what it called a \"guaranteed income\" program in 2017, it became a nationwide sensation. Michael Tubbs, the mayor who brought the program to the area, appeared on national television programs to extol its virtues. Tech moguls toured the city. An HBO documentary was released. It was a rare bit of shine for this dusty agricultural hub, last seen in the national news for the distinction as the largest city to go bankrupt after the Great Recession. Now it was the first American city in decades to take the buzzy idea for a basic income and bring it into the real world, as a potential remedy to the country’s growing inequality. Three years — and one pandemic — later, the Stockton experience offers lessons on the promises of the policy and its limitations. The idea of a universal basic income — that every citizen receives a regular, unconditional cash payment from the government — is gaining traction worldwide, including in the United States, where it is buoyed in part by the federal stimulus measures that are credited with softening the blow of the economic crisis of 2020. On the local level, the concept of a basic income is being explored in more than 40 cities, such as St. Paul, Minn.; Gary, Ind.; and Atlanta, with more than a dozen pursuing pilot programs. For the Stockton participants, the program appears to have been a success. A recent study by researchers who helped design the program found that full-time employment levels increased among the group of people who received the money. Mental and emotional health improved as well, the researchers found. But the program was just a shadow of what UBI proponents, such as former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, believe is possible. It was not universal: Only 125 people participated, and it did not offer a full income, but rather $500 per month in cash. The program ended without a replacement. And Tubbs, who earned so many plaudits for the effort, was voted out of office in November, losing by more than 10 points to a Republican amid criticism of how he managed larger issues in the city, such as homelessness and crime. Tubbs said he thinks the program was also a target of criticism because basic income challenges national myths about work and value. \"The notion of providing an income floor forces people to reckon with the fact that it’s not true that all you have to do is work hard to make it in this country,\" he said. \"There’s people that work two to three jobs and can’t pay rent. It really brings up uncomfortable notions about the economy and how the economy works.\" Now, the question of whether giving people cash is sensible policy is increasingly debated. Beyond handing out stimulus checks, President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package created an expanded program of cash grants to families and the working poor that some liberal Democrats want to make permanent. But the program will last only one year, and it’s unclear whether Biden will get the support in Congress to expand it. Unrestricted cash assistance for the poor, once known as welfare, largely ended in the late 1990s in a bipartisan agreement that reflected concerns that it dissuaded people from working. And the experiences of Stockton and other places suggest that although much political fanfare accompanies short-time efforts to expand payments, particularly to the vulnerable, sustaining such programs is highly challenging. \"There’s been a lot of evidence both here and abroad that things like direct cash payments ... are politically much more effective than the other techniques traditionally used,\" said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. But, he added, \"there are limits. You can’t just keep on doing this forever. It certainly isn’t going to be a steady diet.\" ‘Out of white papers and into the real lived experience’ At first glance, Stockton might seem like an unlikely place for a social experiment at the vanguard of political thought. Situated where the outer reaches of the Bay Area meet the more conservative, rural counties of the San Joaquin Valley, the city never has been considered a political bellwether in the state. But the prosperity of its coastal neighbors has not materialized here, despite some hopes that tech start-ups would see potential in Stockton, which is an hour and a half away from the inner Bay Area and boasts notably less expensive housing. Poverty levels here are nearly twice the national average, and homelessness has surged in recent years, evident in makeshift tent and RV encampments that line the city’s riverfront. The guaranteed income program was the result of chance. Tubbs, then 26 and the youngest mayor of any comparably sized city in the country, found himself sitting next to Natalie Foster, the co-founder of the Economic Security Project, an anti-poverty nonprofit organization with tech money, at a conference in San Francisco in 2017. The mayor had read about basic income in the writings of Martin Luther King Jr. as a college student at Stanford University. And he was informed by his experience growing up in the city with a single mother who struggled while juggling jobs in retail and health care to support the family. Foster’s organization was looking for a place to test the idea, to \"get it out of white papers and into the real lived experience,\" she said. A match was made. \"My governing philosophy is sort of different than most elected leaders: I believe in moving with a coalition of the willing,\" Tubbs said. \"I thought there was consensus [that] what we were doing on poverty wasn’t working for the city. So I took that as a mandate to figure out what can we do to make it better.\" The program, which was funded with $1 million from the Economic Security Project and an additional $3 million that the organization and Tubbs raised from donors, was designed with the help of two professors, Amy Castro Baker at the University of Pennsylvania and Stacia West at the University of Tennessee, to be a research experiment. Organizers sent mailers to 4,200 households in neighborhoods where the average income was less than $46,000; 125 of the people who responded were chosen to be part of it, receiving $500 a month for two years. Many were so confused by the offer of no-strings-attached money that they thought it was probably a scam. Media access to the participants was tightly controlled. Still, a wave of positive news coverage followed. Locally, too, Tubbs earned accolades from people who had been working in the fight against poverty in Stockton for decades. Anecdotes about the results trickled in to his office through the nonprofit organization that was running the program. \"We’d hear stories about people using the money to find full-time work, buy dentures, take care of their families, take care of other people,\" Tubbs said. \"I went from someone who was skeptically optimistic to being a full-blown evangelist.\"  But it also opened him up to criticism — that he was in it more for his national political standing than addressing real issues in the city on a wide scale. An old idea becomes new again In the United States, a debate about guaranteed income has come up periodically since the 1960s, only to be jettisoned for a less ambitious and more politically palatable alternative. The idea has found a renaissance in recent years, in countries such as Finland, India and Kenya, as inequality has worsened and, in more industrialized countries, fears grow about the shift to automation. And in the United States, it received a boost during the 2020 presidential primaries, helping to power Yang’s upstart campaign. But it took the coronavirus pandemic to truly underscore the potential of cash assistance. Former president Donald Trump was one of the main cheerleaders for more — and bigger — stimulus payments after attaching his name to the first round of checks, for $1,200, in March 2020. By the end of the year, about two dozen House Republicans lined up to support another round of payments, challenging the GOP’s traditional aversion to social welfare spending. \"The experience of the pandemic and the programs adopted to address it — particularly the cash aid — have really opened up this space to much more unconditional forms of aid,\" said Marshall Steinbaum, an economist at the University of Utah. \"It totally rejects the conventional wisdom in policy circles since the 1990s that if the government wants to help everyone, it has to be very selective in who gets help and very onerous in the requirements.\" Yang puts it in simpler terms. \"The cash worked,\" he said in an interview. \"It stimulated the economy; it kept millions of households afloat; and the benefits were clear to both individuals and families and economists who were scared stiff of the consequences of the massive layoffs.\" In Brazil, basic income ideas have been bubbling for more than 20 years, but like in the United States, it took a pandemic — and a right-wing populist leader facing heat amid a crisis — to implement the policy on the national scale, temporarily. The Brazilian government distributed $52 billion to nearly 68 million people in the country last year who were either out of work, informal workers or extremely poor, about $107 a month per person, and more for single mothers. The effort helped boost President Jair Bolsonaro’s political ratings even as the coronavirus battered the nation. But the country also showed a shortcoming with such programs. When the funding ran out, poor households were thrown back into turmoil. \"It guaranteed a minimum of dignity for many people,\" Josiani Salinos, a community leader in southern Brazil, said in an interview. \"Now, we see how much we miss emergency aid. People are selling their personal belongings, such as televisions and refrigerators, on the streets.\" Other mayors join the bandwagon, unconcerned about political risks The program in Stockton ended in January and many participants — at least those who are permitted by the nonprofit organization that ran the program to speak to reporters — say it changed their lives. Lorrine Paradela, 46, a single mother, said the money allowed her to quit the second job she worked on top of her full-time position, working with special needs children in schools. She also said she has more peace of mind, knowing that when unexpected expenses come up, she’ll be better prepared. \"Before, my brain just kept working all the time. Even though all my bills were paid and we had food, you always think about the next month coming,\" she said. Tomas Vargas Jr., 35, a father of two, said the money enabled him to look more aggressively for a full-time job, while working part-time at UPS. About a year and a half into the program, Vargas was offered a full-time job, at a local nonprofit organization, Fathers and Families of San Joaquin, and he credits the program. \"For what I was being paid, if I would risk taking the day off and then do an interview — and then say if I didn’t get the job or it wasn’t assured I would have the job — I wouldn’t be able to risk it, because I’d lose all my income,\" Vargas said. But the program holds some cautionary lessons despite these successes. Tubbs was attacked ruthlessly as being in it for himself by the 209Times, a local blog that has a has a far bigger following on most social media channels than the local newspaper. The blog pointed to the income program, among many other issues, to raise doubts about Tubbs’s integrity — claiming that he used the project to help drum up support for his own ambitions. Founder Motecuzoma Sanchez has told reporters that the site is not run as journalism but denies that the information he puts out is untrue. Sanchez did not respond to a request for comment. The program in Stockton also may have been a victim of its modesty; with only 125 participants, there wasn’t a large enough pool of beneficiaries to generate a base of support. \"I think Tubbs felt like he was riding a high and beautiful wave and that his work with UBI [and] also other programs would speak for themselves,\" Stockton Record columnist Michael Fitzgerald said. \"He underestimated that if there’s a bad narrative out there, no matter how fraudulent it is, if there’s no counternarrative, people are going to believe it.\" The number of mayors who have started similar programs in the past year has grown sharply, indicating that other officials think the programs are worth a try. \"This type of policy is only controversial in the halls of government, in city hall, in the capitals, in Washington, D.C.,\" said Melvin Carter, the first Black mayor of St. Paul, which began a program last year. \"Meanwhile, just about every resident knows that if it’s not them, they know somebody who needs cash right now. Sure, there will be people who don’t like it. Anything we do that’s big, impactful and changes the status quo, there will be somebody who doesn’t like it.\" Tubbs now runs the group Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, which is organizing a growing number of mayors such as Carter who are testing the program in their cities, with the help of more than $18 million in donations from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. Last month, he was named a special economic adviser to California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), a position in which he will help the state explore cash payment programs, as well as other anti-poverty proposals. \"It’s risky when you’re the first; when you’re the 45th, it’s not that risky,\" he said. \"Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitably.\""

    "content": "As Andrew Yang roams through New York’s uncharacteristically empty streets, he chats with supporters, waves at sanitation workers and drops into a Brooklyn barbershop. Narrating those scenes in a video he posted Wednesday night, Yang boasts of his New York roots while boosting his signature issues, like universal basic income. \"We need to realize Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of a guaranteed minimum income and get cash into the hands of people who need it most,\" Yang said in the 2½-minute ad. Yang’s video made official his entry to a crowded field of seasoned local politicians hoping to succeed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), who is term-limited from running again. I moved to New York City 25 years ago. I came of age, fell in love, and became a father here. Seeing our City in so much pain breaks my heart. Let’s fight for a future New York City that we can be proud of – together. Join us at https://t.co/TGnxwuBiHB pic.twitter.com/n9zxPybgbh — Andrew Yang🧢🗽🇺🇸 (@AndrewYang) January 14, 2021 Fresh off the buzz of an upstart presidential campaign that earned Yang a loyal following in the Democratic primaries that coalesced under the #YangGang moniker, he figures to be a major fundraiser and serious contender. But in New York, some critics have begun circling, questioning why Yang and his family left town during the pandemic and highlighting some of his more unusual campaign pledges — including a vow to bring TikTok Hype Houses to the city. Yang, an entrepreneur and philanthropist, was born in Schenectady, N.Y., and moved to Manhattan for law school. He stayed, and lives in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood with his wife and two sons. He joined the jam-packed Democratic primary field as a largely unknown figure, but built a considerable following by the time he dropped his bid last February. Yang filed his paperwork to run for New York mayor earlier, but he made his official debut as a candidate with his video Wednesday, the day he turned 46. Once again, he’s an outsider in the race — he has never worked in city government and didn’t vote in the past four mayoral elections. Yang is centering his bid on a similar promise as his presidential campaign: a guaranteed minimum income for New York City residents. He also proposes creating \"a People’s Bank so it stops being so expensive to be poor,\" as he said in the video. Some critics questioned his commitment to the city — a refrain that escalated after a profile in the New York Times on Monday noted he had been riding out the pandemic in Upstate New York. \"We live in a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. And so, like, can you imagine trying to have two kids on virtual school in a two-bedroom apartment, and then trying to do work yourself?\" Yang told the Times. Scott Stringer, the city’s comptroller and a mayoral candidate, tweeted in response to the quote: \"Yes, actually I can.\" Eric Adams, Brooklyn borough president and another candidate for mayor, tweeted the city deserved a leader who was not \"out-of-touch.\" Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive who is also running, said she spent the year \"living with THREE generations under one roof, AND running a campaign from home.\" In a statement to the Times, Yang defended his family’s decision to spend most of their time in the Hudson Valley. \"We took our two kids, including my autistic son, to Upstate New York to help him adapt to our new normal,\" Yang said. \"Evelyn and I know how lucky we are to have that option, which is why I’ve committed the past several years of my life to lifting up working families and eliminating poverty.\" On Wednesday, Yang found another policy to shake up the race: TikTok Hype Houses. Yang’s proposal, highlighted in a viral tweet from a Times reporter, would attract young Internet creators to the city to form collectives, like those where TikTok stars live together and collaborate. \"We need to help create similar artist collectives that utilize new technologies,\" Yang writes. The idea lead to some taunting on Twitter, where some called on Yang to focus more on regular New Yorkers who can’t afford rent rather than teens who go viral on TikTok. In his announcement video, which was directed by the Oscar-nominated director Darren Aronofsky, Yang also pledged to improve technology in the city’s classrooms. \"We’ll bring New York City into the 21st century by getting everyone high-speed Internet so our kids can learn,\" he said. Another promise, though, seemed destined to spark its own conflict among basketball fans. \"Maybe we can even save the Knicks,\" Yang said."

That month, Canada lost more than 1 million jobs, and no one knew when, or if, those jobs were coming back. The $500-per-week CERB became a lifeline to more than 8 million Canadians. (All figures in this article are in Canadian dollars; 500 Canadian dollars is equivalent to $382 in U.S. money.) Most people whose income dropped below $2,000 per month and who made at least $5,000 in 2019 are eligible for the benefit. Many have since called for CERB to be transitioned into some kind of universal basic income (UBI) lasting beyond the pandemic. In August, Leah Gazan, a member of Parliament from the New Democratic Party, served a motion for the government to create a guaranteed livable basic income based on the CERB. This sparked a new round of debates in Canada about whether a universal income should be a new social program. In a period where wealth inequality has grown increasingly obvious, and as the pandemic has knocked the economy on its head, it’s no surprise that so many would look to a basic income as a solution. The problem is that a basic income cannot fix income inequality if it doesn’t address the underlying costs that drive poverty. The most appealing part of a basic income program is linked to what makes it politically sticky: It is universal, but extremely expensive. CERB alone risks reaching $100 billion if extended to 2021 — and it’s not universal. Canadians who made less than $5,000 in 2019 were left out of the relief plan, and so, too, was everyone making more than $2,000 per month but who still live in poverty. With average rent in Toronto for a one-bedroom apartment at $2,300, a benefit of $2,000 per month doesn’t go very far. As a comparison, health-care spending from all levels of government — provincial, territorial and federal — is just under $185 billion. A modest guaranteed income would likely cost more than all public health services spending combined. Advocates argue that the money to fund any universal program must come from increased taxation, and that the combination of the two would be an important mechanism to rebalance wealth in Canada. Gazan’s colleague, NDP MP Peter Julian, served a motion this summer to create a new wealth tax, which would result in about $5.6 billion in new revenue for the federal government. During the 2019 election, the NDP also promised to increase corporate tax rates and go after money hidden in tax havens, measures that were estimated to generate $12.1 billion in the first year. While these policies will help mitigate some of Canada’s income inequality, they don’t go far enough. Nor would they bring in enough revenue to fund a UBI while maintaining current levels of social services spending. Income inequality in Canada was relatively stable in the post-World War II period but started to increase in the mid-1990s. At the same time, the Liberal government cut more than $18 billion in programs spending. Inequality peaked in 2006, where the top 1 percent of wealthiest Canadians represented 13.6 percent of market share. By 2017, it had fallen slightly to 11.3 percent. Income inequality is also deeply racialized, with White Canadians far more likely to be wealthy. To effectively target these inequalities, society has to first ensure that public services are in place to sustainably meet people’s needs. Every Canadian is estimated to spend just over $1,000 annually on private drug costs and premiums. If these costs rise, a guaranteed income starts to evaporate. A national Pharmacare program, estimated to cost $15 billion, would eliminate these costs. Similarly, a national child-care program would make a big difference for families who pay $10,000 per child, per year on average. The same goes for elder care, as researchers Michel Grignon and Nicole F. Bernier estimate that each Canadian must save $7,500 per year for 40 years to be able to pay for expensive care in the final years of their lives. Then there are private market costs, such as rents or mortgages, transit or car payments and the cost of food. Without market controls to keep these costs low, a basic income would be little more than a transfer of wealth from the public purse to private hands through an individual’s monthly stipend. This is the critical problem with a universal basic income: It has become a silver-bullet solution to all of the problems that austerity and neoliberalism have created, but it would not address any core problems. The CERB makes good sense during the pandemic and should continue as long as we live with covid-19. But what we need far more than an annual basic income are free and accessible public services such as child care, health care, transit, elder care and higher education, paid for through increased taxes on Canada’s most wealthy.

At first, his announcements were dramatic — even disturbing. The closure of the U.S.-Canadian border. A shutdown of immigration. Yet as the weeks roll on, the updates have grown increasingly mundane and technical. Much of his time is now merely spent revisiting and revising the various financial aid programs intended to assist Canadians whose livelihoods have been hurt by the pandemic. Constant revisions haven’t exactly made these programs a breeze to understand. A friend of mine seeking to secure the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) — the government’s marquee initiative for those directly affected by covid-19 — has been taking daily screenshots of the program’s online application page, documenting its changes. On April 6, the Who can apply section consisted of four simple bullet points. Today, the criteria are riddled with subclauses, restrictions and qualifiers. Those who fail to meet CERB eligibility are welcome to navigate the government’s equally intimidating online hub of narrowly tailed financial assistance packages for equally narrow classes of Canadians, including students, seniors, young entrepreneurs, low-income essential workers and aboriginal small-business owners. Such complexity has naturally invited accusations of bureaucratic insensitivity. The left-leaning Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, for instance, has estimated that more than 800,000 unemployed Canadians will receive nothing from these programs during the crisis because their circumstances exist outside the rigid parameters of the new programs — notably Canadians who were unemployed before the crisis, and thus can’t opt in to any benefit designed to compensate those hurt due to it. It’s into this context the fashionable cause of universal basic income (UBI) has resurfaced. What if Ottawa simply ditched the whole confusing archipelago of opt-in covid-19 aid and just mailed monthly checks of a couple of thousand dollars to every Canadian instead? Longtime Conservative adviser Ken Boessenkool, who claims to be a vocal opponent of UBI in principle, has been writing columns pushing what he calls crisis basic income — or a temporary UBI-like subsidy for all Canadians that’s conditional on the existence of the coronavirus pandemic. On the other end, New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh has taken to demanding the federal government eliminate all barriers of access for the CERB program, explicitly using the phrase Universal Basic Income to describe his desired outcome. Both right and left have framed their endorsements as pragmatic: If Canadians are hurting, and that pain requires immediate alleviation, why not err on the side of blind generosity? The media wants to proclaim a growing UBI movement. But even amid crisis, it seems unlikely the eccentric idea will overcome the decades of deeply engrained psychosocial resistance that blunts its traction at the best of times. During the 1990s, when Canada’s welfare programs were last substantially revised, a clear consensus was established that unchecked government generosity is both fiscally and morally irresponsible. As such, the challenge facing UBI advocates is not that their idea lacks common-sense appeal, but that the status quo has an appealing common sense of its own. Canada’s financial aid bureaucracy is broadly infused with a certain cynicism about man’s assumed tendency toward sloth and avarice. For example, Employment Insurance does not provide equivalent income to your previous job — only 55 percent — because the intent is to discourage dependence. The new CERB program and other coronavirus-era subsidies are likewise guarded with strict qualification criteria because the government seems to take it for granted that there would be a rush of exploitation otherwise: wealthy people seeking to nab a bit of extra cash, EI recipients looking to double dip and so forth. Pessimistic though they may be, such assumptions will nevertheless strike many Canadians as not just morally correct but also fiscally wise — especially during an already profligate period of emergency spending. A UBI-type system, by contrast, has no real pretense of being affordable or immune to abuse. Even conservative proponents tend to be deeply ambiguous about how a welfare program with absolutely no means-testing could be financially sustainable — even in the short term. The ask is to simply accept a high-risk, high-cost program in order to provide maximum guarantee that absolutely no needy Canadian gets left behind. Is the trade-off persuasive? If there was clear proof the covid-19 crisis was ushering in a new era of national unity and openness to collective sacrifice, a shake-up of Canadian welfare in a less judgmental, universalist direction might be an easy sell. Instead, the idea is being floated amid a storm of escalating material resentments between old and young, rich and poor, east and west, private sector and public, online and not. The last thing any bureaucracy will do is concede its irrelevance. Canada’s system of dealing out dole might be bloated, intimidating and inefficient, but for the time being, its ideological foundations are probably solid enough to survive this particular pandemic."

    "URL": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/06/06/rep-rashida-tlaib-introduces-closest-plan-congress-universal-basic-income/",
    "content": "Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) has released a plan to spend trillions of federal dollars on direct cash subsidies to working class and poor Americans, including the unemployed and those with no earnings. Tlaib’s bill would give direct cash help to those at the bottom of the income distribution — annually offering $3,000 to individuals and $6,000 to families — in an attempt to reduce poverty in the United States and bolster the wages of the poor. The Michigan lawmaker’s proposal expands on a bill from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), which would also direct trillions in tax credits to low-income Americans but offers no or smaller benefits for the poorest people in the United States. By contrast, Tlaib’s plan offers the full $3,000 or $6,000 credit to those with no income — a significant break from orthodoxy among more centrist Democrats, who have traditionally argued giving federal cash to the unemployed will discourage them from finding jobs.  The revision means Tlaib’s plan is the closest Congress has seen to a \"universal basic income,\" or the idea that every American should get a check from the federal government that they can live on, according to more than a half-dozen economists and policy experts. Tlaib’s plan does not count fully toward a UBI, because it does not offer assistance to more affluent families. The congresswoman said in an interview that her intention is not to craft a UBI plan but to ensure that Americans who earn nothing also receive a generous benefit, citing her experience working with disabled people, students, caretakers and the elderly. \"To kick them out of this category and say, ‘They deserve less’ — to me, it doesn’t make any sense,\" said Tlaib, whose congressional district includes Detroit and is one of the poorest in the country. \"These are my folks. These are our neighbors who need it most.\" Tlaib’s bill, called the LIFT+ Act, has little chance of approval by a Republican-controlled Senate or White House, but it represents a shift in economic policy and welfare policy among Democratic lawmakers that could further expose internal party fissures. A first-term lawmaker, Tlaib is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and ally of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has also urged the Democratic Party to push more aggressive government intervention. She made headlines earlier this year for using a profanity in calling for President Trump’s impeachment. But her economy policy also suggests a shift in the party. It has been decades since Democratic lawmakers pushed for programs that offer cash benefits to the working poor and the unemployed alike, said Joshua McCabe, an Endicott College professor who specializes in poverty issues. \"Democrats gave up for a while on trying something like this, but there’s a new wave of Democrats rediscovering this line of thinking,\" McCabe said. \"Generally, both Democrats and Republicans don’t like lumping in payments for the unemployed with payments for those who are working.\" Tlaib’s approach also marks a departure from the policy proposals of a number of leading Democrats running for president. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has proposed the Stronger Way Act to expand the earned-income tax credit, where the benefits phase in. Former congressman John Delaney (D-Md.), another presidential hopeful, has also called for increasing the earned-income tax credit. Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) also proposed a large expansion of this tax credit but maintained the structure that offers smaller benefits to poorer Americans. Almost all of Sen. Harris’s $2.8 trillion tax plan would help middle and working class, study finds Some experts argued there are good reasons Democrats typically structure their plans this way. McCabe, the Endicott College professor, said working class voters traditionally reject federal welfare payments to able-bodied adults who could be employed. \"Historically, you get a backlash from the working class when you lump together ‘the working poor’ and ‘the welfare poor,’ \" McCabe said. Leonard E. Burman, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said the plan could run into political hurdles and warned that it would make the poor less likely to seek employment. \"It’ll discourage people from working who can work,\" Burman said. \"And, politically, there’s much more support for people who are trying to support themselves.\" But other economists celebrated Tlaib’s plan, saying Harris’s legislation would leave out too many of the most destitute Americans. Matt Bruenig, founder of the socialist think tank the People’s Policy Project, argued that it made little sense to tie federal subsidies to work for this group, given that they have other reasons for being out of the labor market. About 90 percent of people in poverty are children, elderly, disabled, students, caretakers or already working, according to federal statistics compiled by the People’s Policy Project. H. Luke Shaefer, a poverty expert at the University of Michigan, said there is substantial data showing a large increase of families going without any cash income over the past 20 years. He said Congress should keep the earned-income tax credit as a work inducement and include a separate plan, like Tlaib’s, to help those who have fallen out of the labor market. \"The work incentive is good, but we should layer something on top of that so we’re not leaving out the poorest families. You can keep the work incentive and not cut people out who have fallen on extremely hard times,\" Shaefer said. About 2 million Americans have no gross income, according to the Internal Revenue Service, while another 10 million have between $1 and $5,000 in gross income. A spokeswoman for Harris previously noted that the senator supports other plans to help the very poor, such as Medicare-for-all and expanded Social Security. A spokesman for Harris did not return a request for comment about Tlaib’s legislation. Irwin Garfinkel, dean of the Columbia School of Social Work, argued that Tlaib’s proposal phases out too quickly and should be expanded to include every American, including those with higher earnings. He also said the plan should be amended to include a cash payment for children, citing the nation’s high rates of child poverty. \"Universality, or near universality, is an essential ingredient. This is much too targeted,\" Garfinkel said. Tlaib acknowledged that a true UBI plan would be bigger in scope. But she said the legislation was informed by her time volunteering at a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program for the poor in Wayne County, Mich. \"$2,000, $3,000, $4,000 — that can really transform their lives,\" Tlaib said. \"I just want more people covered.\""

    "content": "This spring, nearly 900 million Indians will be eligible to cast their votes in nationwide general elections. While official campaigning is still weeks away, India’s two principal parties — Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its archrival, the Indian National Congress — are leaving no stone unturned in their quest for votes.First came the BJP government’s announcement that it would guarantee 10 percent of university seats and civil service posts for \"economically weaker sections\" of the populace untouched by existing affirmative action programs. Last week, the dynastic Congress party responded by announcing that Priyanka Gandhi — the latest in the line of Nehru-Gandhi heirs to take the political plunge — would play an active role in the forthcoming campaign. And on Monday, Congress president Rahul Gandhi unveiled what is likely to be his party’s signature campaign priority: a universal basic income for poor families across the country. We cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty. If voted to power in 2019, the Congress is committed to a Minimum Income Guarantee for every poor person, to help eradicate poverty & hunger. This is our vision & our promise. — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) January 28, 2019 The timing of the announcement, which immediately set social media alight and dominated the evening news programs, is almost as interesting as the content: On Friday, the Modi government will present its final budget of its tenure before general elections. While the government was widely expected to unveil its own income support scheme for rural Indians, who have grown anxious amid low commodity prices and rising debts, it now finds itself in danger of being outmaneuvered. In politics, big is good, and bigger is better. The government must at least match what the Congress has to offer or risk losing the perceptions game. Ironically, it was the Modi government that first mooted the idea of a universal basic income in its 2017 flagship economic survey. While the government has shown no haste in carrying the idea forward, two opposition-controlled states — Telangana and Odisha — have since implemented a partial income guarantee scheme squarely aimed at lifting farmers’ incomes. More recently, the ruling party in the state of Sikkim — a BJP ally — has announced it will unveil a comprehensive universal basic income by 2022. The Congress’ surprise announcement is emblematic of most blue-sky campaign promises: long on promise and short on specifics. Implementing any large-scale income support program calls for two essential ingredients: state capacity and fiscal resources. Unfortunately, both are in short supply in India. The country’s social service plumbing is notoriously feeble: India’s welfare machinery suffers from endemic \"leakage\" (or corruption) and \"poor targeting\" (an inability to properly identify and deliver benefits to eligible recipients). Furthermore, India’s fiscal accounts are underwater. Last week, the International Monetary Fund’s chief economist flagged the country’s fiscal deficit as a major economic risk factor, especially in an election year prone to populist giveaways. Neither the Congress nor the BJP has grappled with the realities of implementing a universal basic income for 200 million rural households, but a proposal unveiled this week by a team led by Arvind Subramanian — the former chief economic adviser to the Modi government — provides a tantalizing blueprint for dispensing cash to India’s neediest citizens while potentially circumventing the country’s administrative infirmities. Subramanian, now a visiting lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, and his co-authors have called for the next Indian government to implement what they call a QUBRI, or a quasi-universal basic rural income for India. The idea is simple enough: The government would provide an annual lump sum payment to every poor rural household in India — no questions asked — as a financial safety net. The proposal suggests an annual transfer of 18,000 rupees (1,500 rupees per month) to each eligible rural household — about $250 annually. To target recipients effectively, the proposed QUBRI would exclude the richest 25 percent of households. Transfers would be sent electronically to recipient bank accounts, which are ubiquitous now even in remote areas thanks to a recent government effort to universalize banking access. The authors estimate the costs of the scheme would be around 1.3 percent of India’s gross domestic product — a significant chunk of which would come from eliminating a raft of regressive agricultural subsidies. This sounds wonderful in practice, but the politics are not nearly as cut and dry. For starters, if eliminating farmer subsidies were painless, the government would have done it a long time ago. Research suggests that many Indians are leery of giving up existing subsidies in favor of uncertain cash transfers. Moreover, the existing debate is exclusively focused on India’s rural dwellers. But it is India’s urban population that is burgeoning as migrants flock to cities in search of opportunity. The inadequacy of formal-sector jobs and the abysmal state of urban amenities suggest it is only a matter of time before urban residents demand their share of government largesse. For now, these technical details will be left to the economists and opinion writers to debate. For India’s politicians, there’s an election to be won. But the question remains: Will the Indian electorate really be wooed by a mere promise of easy cash? In 2014, voters were drawn to Modi like a moth to a flame, swayed by his pledge of ushering in \"acche din\" (good times) for the Indian economy, generating millions of jobs and reviving India’s moribund investment cycle. Five years later, his promises remain unfulfilled and voters, for their part, have begun to expect more. "

    "URL": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2017/10/16/what-silicon-valley-gets-wrong-about-universal-basic-income/",
    "content": "According to my estimate, roughly half of all jobs will disappear in the next decade. Routine and mechanical occupations will soon be replaced by artificial intelligence and robots at an unprecedented rate across the globe. This enormous challenge has breathed new life into an old idea called universal basic income, or UBI, in which the government provides a steady stipend for each citizen regardless of need, employment status or skill level. So should we blindly give $10,000 to everyone then? Absolutely not. The optimists naively assume that UBI will be a catalyst for people to reinvent themselves professionally. But UBI makes sense only when Silicon Valley leaders project their own personas onto all the workers who will be displaced. Indeed, if we’re talking about a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur, his or her skills, entrepreneurship, experience and network may successfully help turn a modest UBI income into the next tech empire. But this most surely will not happen for the masses of displaced workers with obsolete skills living in regions where job loss is exacerbated by traditional economic downturn. Free money given out to displaced workers may serendipitously help a few find work, but more likely, they will just move on to a new job that will also be eliminated soon. This is a familiar pattern we have seen throughout the workforce. The truck driver who once worked on an assembly line in a factory will soon have to learn, yet again, to become something else. Most displaced workers will not have the foresight to predict which professions might survive the AI revolution and therefore won’t know how to best use the UBI money to ensure a stable future. Instead of just redistributing cash and hoping for the best, we must work together to find a comprehensive solution, including establishing new professions, values and social norms. And we need to retrain and adapt so that everyone can find a suitable profession. Here are five imperatives to get us there: 1. Guarantee subsistence. The first priority is to create and support programs to ensure no one goes hungry or without shelter and basic health care. 2. Maximize creative jobs. Only humans can create and come up with new innovations. AI today cannot think outside the box, and it can only optimize problems defined by humans. Thus, in early education, we must ensure that the system does not inhibit curiosity, creativity, critical thinking and individuality. In middle school and high school, we should increase funding for gifted and talented programs. In colleges, we need programs that help students with creative potential learn to master AI tools. 3. Increase social jobs. AI cannot express love and empathy and cannot build irreplaceable social connections – only people can. And unlike creative professions, which cannot easily be taught, people can be trained in a large number of social professions. Furthermore, with the projected trillions of dollars I predict AI will generate, consumer spending will go up and with it, spending on people-to-people services. This means service jobs that require a human touch – social workers, therapists, teachers and life coaches – will be in high demand. Furthermore, new social jobs will be invented in which humans will serve as an intermediary of sorts between patrons and AI. For example, a medical consultant might help patients troubleshoot and give supplemental advice when using an AI diagnostic tool. Some of these jobs will even be highly paid. 4. Encourage voluntarism. We need to create more volunteer programs to assist retired and displaced workers with little interest in or skillset for higher skilled professions. We should also consider compensating people who volunteer. 5. Redefine work ethic. Everyone has a need to feel a sense of self-worth and self-actualization – that he or she believes his or her existence is meaningful. Unfortunately, the Industrial Revolution wrongfully instilled a social norm that self-worth should primarily come from work ethic – if you work hard, you will be rewarded. But because of AI, jobs based on repetitive tasks will soon be gone forever. We need to redefine the idea of work ethic for the new workforce paradigm. The importance of a job should not be solely dependent on its economic value but should also be measured by what it adds to society. We should also reassess our notion that longer work hours are the best way to achieve success and should remove the stigma associated with service professions. The coming AI revolution will bring about either the best of times or the worst of times. The outcome will depend on whether we choose to be intoxicated by naive optimism or committed to comprehensive problem solving. UBI is clearly not enough. We need to debate earnestly and experiment rapidly. Only then will this amazing revolution lead us to a creative renaissance."

In less than five years, they will load self-driving trucks that transport goods to local distribution centers where drones will make last-mile deliveries. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post) Soon afterward, autonomous cars will begin to take the wheel from taxi drivers; artificial intelligence will exceed the ability of human doctors to understand complex medical data; industrial robots will do manufacturing; and supermarkets won’t need human cashiers. The majority of jobs that require human labor and intellectual capability are likely to disappear over the next decade and a half. There will be many new jobs created, but not for the people who have lost them — because they do not have those skills. And this will lead to major social disruption unless we develop sound policies to ease the transition.The industry behind these advances — and reaping huge financial rewards from them — has been in denial. Tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, for example, calls the jobless future \"a Luddite fallacy\"; he insists that people will be re-employed. But now others, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla’s Elon Musk and Bill Gates, are acknowledging a skills mismatch with the potential for mass unemployment.  They advocate a Universal Basic Income (UBI), a payment by the government that provides for the basic wants and needs of the population. But these tech moguls are simply kicking the can down the hill and shifting responsibility to Washington. UBI will not solve the social problems that come from loss of people’s purpose in life and of their social stature and identity — which jobs provide.  And the politicians in Washington who are working to curtail basic benefits such as health care and food stamps plainly won’t consider the value of spending trillions on a new social-welfare scheme. In a paper titled \"A New Deal for the Twenty-First Century,\" Edward Alden and Bob Litan, of the Council on Foreign Relations, propose solutions for retraining the workforce.  They believe that there will be many new jobs created in technology and in caring for the elderly — because Western populations are aging. The authors say that young people starting careers should be equipped with the education and skills needed to adapt to career changes; and that older workers who become displaced should receive assistance in finding new jobs and retraining for new careers. Government shouldn’t provide the jobs or training but should, the authors say, offer tax incentives and insurance, facilitate job mobility, and reform occupational licensing. To encourage employees to gain new skills, there should be \"career loan accounts\" from which they can fund their own education — with repayment being linked to future earnings. To minimize the effect of wage cuts resulting from changing professions, Alden and Litan advocate a generous wage-insurance scheme that tops up earnings; enhancements to the Earned Income Tax Credit; direct wage subsidies; and minimum wage increments. They believe too that a voluntary military and civilian national service program for young people would help alleviate the social disruption and teach important new skills and provide tutoring to disadvantaged students, help for the elderly, and improvements of public spaces such as parks and playgrounds. These ideas are a good start, but the focus was on maintaining a balance between Republicans and Democrats, on being politically palatable. The coming disruptions are likely be so cataclysmic that we need to go beyond politics. We have already seen the increasing anger of the electorate from both the right and the left in the U.S. elections. We are witnessing the same in Europe now. As technology advances and changes everything about the way we live and work, this will get much worse. We must understand the human issues — the trauma and suffering of affected people — and work to minimize the impacts. As Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program Executive Director Sharon Block said to me in an email: \"I don’t think we can be limited in our thinking by what can get through Congress now — nothing can.  We need to be using this time to come up with the big new ideas to develop a bolder progressive vision for the future — and then work to create the conditions necessary to implement that vision.\" The problem here is that with this future fast approaching, not even the inventors of the technologies have a real answer. This is why there is an urgent need to bring policymakers, academics and business leaders together to brainstorm on solutions and to do grand, global experiments."

    "content": "Donald Trump — a man who is cozy with white supremacists, violence, religious bigotry and misogyny — is the likely presidential nominee of Lincoln’s party. One quite minor consequence of this ongoing disaster is that I find it hard to say much at all about U.S. public affairs other than to make the simple observation that, well, Trump is an ongoing disaster. So in searching for something to write about with more layers than Trump, I looked abroad, to Finland of all places. And to Canada, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. All of these countries, to one degree or another, are exploring universal basic income. Imagine eliminating the entire welfare state — no more food stamps, cash and housing assistance, payments to the disabled, and all of the rest — and replacing it with a simple, elegant, single program: Every American gets a check just for being a citizen. All Americans would be given enough money to ensure that everyone can afford the basics necessary to live above the poverty line. This program — universal basic income (UBI) — promises great relief to its beneficiaries. No longer are the poor subject to the whims, requirements and irritations of government bureaucracy. Under UBI, the welfare state is eliminated; the bureaucracy, gone. Gone, too, is the stigma associated with drawing benefits — if everyone wears the UBI scarlet letter, then no one does. Eliminated are the \"poverty traps\" associated with the \"phase outs\" of many of today’s safety net programs; UBI never phases out, so an extra dollar of work does not result in a loss of safety-net benefits. In a world with UBI, citizens no longer need to go to the government when the circumstances of their lives change: when they lose jobs, become disabled or see their incomes fall below a certain level. Of course, there are many ways to implement a UBI program, with many bells and whistles that can and cannot be included. But the basic structure asks much from citizens by providing a base of economic security on which liberty must be properly practiced. Simply put, if you choose to spend your UBI check on drugs and alcohol and subsequently find yourself hungry and homeless, the government won’t help you. For UBI advocates, this is a feature, not a bug: Under UBI, citizens are responsible for their own choices. Even if those choices are bad, they remain their choices. Liberty is elevated; paternalism is dealt a devastating blow. But perhaps liberty is elevated a bit too much? At the risk of sounding unfashionable, one reason that I can’t support UBI — despite its many attractive and seductive features — is that we need a little paternalism. It is right and just that we have a social safety net — in a nation as wealthy as ours, no one should be able to fall too far. But UBI money doesn’t come from the Money Tree, and that reality needs to be respected. If we take money from John to give to Matthew, who would starve without it, then we owe it to John to make sure that his money is appropriately spent on Matthew’s food and shelter, not on Matthew’s alcohol and gambling. And surely there are a lot of Matthews out there who, if given the chance, would spend John’s money on alcohol and gambling. In addition, we can be confident that under UBI, at least some people will be taken advantage of, losing their benefit money. The children of recipients who spend their UBI unwisely also stand to lose quite a bit, and society needs to keep those children at the forefront of mind when evaluating safety-net programs. In short, the wisdom of in-kind benefits would be made readily apparent if we adopted UBI. Although removing stigma and the need to ask the government for help are appealing, they also result in outcomes of questionable morality. My wife is a very healthy woman. My neighbor has a serious physical disability. Should both receive the same amount of support from the government? Should a healthy man in his 20s and a blind man in his 40s be treated equally by the social safety net? I don’t think so. But under the logic of UBI, they would be. Or would they? Another issue with UBI is its lack of realism. If UBI were introduced here, it wouldn’t take long for a politician to point out that, say, blind people need more support than those without physical disabilities. And then that workers who are disabled on the job deserve extra support over and above their base-line UBI benefit. And then it wouldn’t take very long for UBI to transform into something that looks very much like the system we have today. Why, then, change in the first place? Then, of course, there is work. UBI would reduce work by reducing the need to work. If you think work is good, as I do, then this is a bad outcome. A job provides much more than a paycheck. At a basic level, work occupies our time, which can be quite good in and of itself. (Do you want to live in a world filled with young men who don’t need to work?) Perhaps more significantly, working liberates us from our passions by directing them to the end of social improvement, creating a society characterized by mutual contribution, mutual dependence and mutual obligation. In a UBI world, those who choose to work will support those who choose not to — not those who can’t work, but those who won’t. This really would be a world of makers and takers. That’s not a world I want to live in."

    "content": "Debates around the social safety net are too easily characterized by their extremists: libertarian conservatives seeking to dissolve any restriction on free exchange, or near-Marxists who never met a hard-earned dollar that they didn’t want to redistribute. But an alternative school of criticism would claim that capitalism and the socialist ideal are both flawed — both tend to unravel the bonds that tie communities together, offering only money as a substitute. A universal basic income, should it ever come to fruition, would likely represent the withering of America’s social fabric through the combination of the free market and welfare state. While it is easy to foresee an environment in which cutting a check to every citizen would be a reasonable and perhaps even necessary policy solution, we should earnestly hope to escape that fate. By the time a true universal basic income would be justifiable, both the capitalists and the government would be purchasing more than mere domestic nondisturbance: they would be buying many of us out of civil society altogether. The economist F. A. Hayek was an early articulator of the basic income ideal. He described a policy in which the government provided  \"a certain minimum income for everyone, or a sort of floor below which nobody need fall even when he is unable to provide for himself.\" Importantly, however, Hayek framed the idea as being a necessary part of a new \"Great Society,\" one in which \"the individual no longer has specific claims on the members of the particular small group into which he was born.\" Hayek’s safety net would take care of the vulnerable after the mobility of a market economy had dissolved the traditional supports of family and community. And his \"Great Society\" had to be one of sufficient wealth to have enough surplus to provide for the security of all. This has often been the justification for welfare state expansions: that they are a modern, generous society’s way of offering shelter from capitalism’s creative destruction, and a respite from the ever-present pressure to make ends meet. The welfare state is the great compromise between the free-market capitalist and the redistributive socialist, one in which captains of industry set aside a portion of their wealth to provide for the lower classes populists accuse them of exploiting, and to purchase the relative social tranquility upon which their shareholders believe a successful business rests. Just as Hayek notes that a society of a certain amount of wealth can afford to cushion its dispossessed, our 21st-century economy seems potentially capable of eventually covering the tab of a universal basic income. \"Unicorns\" are frolicking in Silicon Valley, after all, and we’re on the verge of reaching new horizons in automation. Soon, our capital-intensive investments in robotics and other new technologies will begin to yield great returns — ones that won’t be tempered by the cost of healthcare premiums today or pensions down the line. Advocates for a basic income insist that it would grant low-wage workers the bargaining power to resist bad employers. Rather than being forced by necessity to compete with newly automated employees for low-wage job, they would be \"empowered\" to stay home or engage in other pursuits. A no-strings-attached material cushion would allow otherwise working drones the chance for more leisure, and the opportunity to invest their time and money more freely. But the freedom of no longer being needed is a vicious gift to give, and \"no strings attached\" money is rarely as costless as it seems. When we enter the marketplace, ties are formed between people: between employer and employee, between customer and salesperson, between coworkers and suppliers and the sandwich shop next door. These transactions and interactions are the threads that bind individuals together at the most granular level, weaving them into the multi-layered, tight-knit, resilient fabric of civil society. And it is necessity — our reliance on work to provide for our material concerns — that draws us into that essential weave. A universal basic income, however, would not connect us to each other. Rather than knitting us to our coworkers, our employees, our collaborators and our families, a basic income would tie every American directly back to Washington, via millions of isolated and attenuated threads. It might sound grand to be able to give a check to every citizen. But if we would need to unravel the social fabric to get there, it’s a cost we should not hope to afford."

    "title": "Thinking Utopian: How about a universal basic income?",
    "source": "Washington Post",
    "author": "Mike Konczal",
    "URL": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/11/thinking-utopian-how-about-a-universal-basic-income/",
    "content": "In light of the recent Oregon Medicaid study, several people have discussed the idea of taking parts of the social insurance system and replacing them with cash benefits. This naturally brings up the debate about whether it should be a policy goal for the United States to adopt a universal basic income (UBI). These poverty-level targeted incomes are universal and unconditional, so everyone would get them regardless of their income, status or work participation. Wonkblog’s Dylan Matthews wrote an overview of universal basic incomes and some proposals for such a system last year. Though establishing a basic income was once at the forefront of politics, it has since become more of a Utopian, abstract project. But sometimes it is helpful to step back from the day-to-day wonk work and think Utopian. First, what are some advantages of providing a universal basic income? To those on the left, a UBI would create greater equality by ending poverty and providing a minimum living standard. It would also increase bargaining power for workers, who could demand better working conditions with a safety cushion. As Erik Olin Wright argues in Envisioning Real Utopias, such bargaining power \"will generate an incentive structure for employers to seek technical and organizational innovations that eliminate unpleasant work,\" which would \"have not just a labor-saving bias, but a labor-humanizing bias.\" The fact that it is universal is crucial. This eliminates income traps that can cause severe work disincentives. A UBI answers the Foucauldian critique about the welfare state being a way for the state to stigmatize and control marginalized populations. There are no state officials determining whether or not a single mom \"deserves\" help or drug tests and other invasive, humiliating requirements. Others see UBI as a way of recognizing the value of decommodified caregiving and other cooperative, non-labor activities, by making sure there is space in the economy to both reward and carry them out. Meanwhile, a few conservatives have advocated a form of basic income for a different set of reasons. The right likes basic income because it would allow for the removal of many overlapping and piecemeal government programs, such as food stamps and unemployment insurance, as well as programs the government directly runs. Charles Murray has advocated a universal basic income of $10,000 for every person, and paying for it by ending Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, virtually all transfer programs and certain tax breaks. Also, if you squint really hard, you could see a libertarian argument that a basic income compensates for the private appropriation of common, natural resources. Eliminating poverty is an essential part of any egalitarian project, and a universal basic income could finish that in one move. But the question then becomes: What projects would still animate the left? And how would a universal basic income influence those projects? One project would be to make sure merit goods are sufficiently provided to everyone who needs them. There are certain goods that we owe to each other -- education, health care, a secure retirement  -- and it isn’t clear that the private market is capable of providing a basic minimum across society. In addition, the government has unique abilities that allow it to provide these goods more efficiently. Medicare is able to hold down costs better than private insurance, and Social Security is working significantly better than 401(k)s or private pensions in providing income security in old age. These programs work very well, and as Ezra Klein noted, they are part of the solution, rather than the problem, to providing health care and security in old age. If these programs were removed in a tradeoff to get a universal basic income, it would be a significant step back. So some people, like Barbara Bergmann here, think that we should focus on building a better system of social insurance and public goods with the government’s limited resources, rather than replacing it with a minimum income. Another somewhat related focus of the left is the issue of decommodification, or whether certain goods should be provided through market logic. As Naomi Klein argued in \"Reclaiming the Commons,\" one goal for the left is to oppose \"the privatization of every aspect of life, and the transformation of every activity and value into a commodity.\" This has a long history on the left; Daniel Rodgers argued that a major focus of early 20th century progressives was \"to hold certain elements out of the market's processes, indeed to roll back those parts of the market whose social costs had proved too high.\" According to this line of thought, the goal isn’t to ensure a sufficient amount of market access and purchasing power, but instead to remove markets from the way people interface with certain goods, such as education or health care. As the welfare-state theorist Gøsta Esping-Andersen argued, decommodification is defined as a situation in which \"a service is rendered as a matter of right, and when a person can maintain a livelihood without reliance on the market.\" A UBI would delink survival and subsistence from the labor market, advancing this goal. Another project is to expand the say workers have in their workplaces. This includes not only unionization, but also a more general project of democracy that doesn’t end once you walk through your employer’s door. As Century Foundation Senior Fellow Richard Kahlenberg and labor attorney Moshe Marvit have argued, labor organizing needs to be considered a basic civil right. It seems clear that a universal basic income would help workers by giving them more bargaining power. But others worry that a UBI would encourage workers to leave the labor force rather than voice grievances and demands, and that it would make changing labor practices more difficult. For instance, some feminists argue that a universal basic income would simply reinforce and solidify an unjust gendered division of labor. In addition to social insurance, the modern, post-New Deal state has two other large roles. There’s a regulatory role in setting the rules of markets and checking market failures. And there’s a macroeconomic role, offsetting the short-term business cycle and investing for long-term prosperity. A UBI would probably make little difference in the regulatory functions of the state, but it could revolutionize the macroeconomic ones. It’s an easy mechanism through which to stabilize aggregate demand using helicopter drops, and could force innovations and productivity gains by industry to balance out workers’ new power. Given that we should consider it a major win if Congress makes it through the year without the GOP forcing a default on the national debt, right now doesn’t seem like the ideal time for Utopian thinking. But taking a moment to think Utopian shows that the core projects of balancing what markets do in our economy and the general commitment to democracy would still continue, and could even be amplified, with a universal basic income."

    "content": "Residents of Stockton, Calif., who received $500 a month from a first-of-its-kind guaranteed-income program were more likely to find full-time jobs, be happy and stay healthy, according to a year-long study published Wednesday. Supporters of universal income programs — which provide regular, unconditional payments from the government to people — say the findings should dispel common criticisms of the idea, such as that money with no strings attached will become a disincentive for people to work or will encourage them to spend it on drugs and alcohol. Recipients of the monthly payments were twice as likely to gain full-time employment than others, according to data analysis by a pair of independent researchers, Stacia West of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and Amy Castro Baker of the University of Pennsylvania. Most of the money distributed was spent on food or other essentials. Tobacco or alcohol made up less than 1 percent of tracked purchases. As lawmakers in Washington consider limiting eligibility for coronavirus stimulus aid, Michael Tubbs, the former mayor of Stockton who began the program in 2017, said the research provides clear support for giving regular payments to people in need — a theory that was once deemed fringe but popularized more recently by tech entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Proposal to send checks to Americans reignites calls for universal income \"The data proves that, particularly in a pandemic, it’s not wise policy to make less people eligible for what we know is necessary and needed,\" Tubbs, who lost his reelection bid last year, said in a video conference Wednesday. Starting in February 2019, the Stockton program has provided monthly payments for two years to 125 people living in neighborhoods with a median income below $46,034. Participants can use the money as they see fit, without work requirements or other restrictions. It is funded by the Economic Security Project, a philanthropic group helmed in part by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Tech giants have thrown their weight behind universal basic income as automation has led to the loss of jobs, testing the idea in Stockton, a suburban city between the liberal Bay Area and Silicon Valley and the more conservative, rural counties to the east. In D.C.'s Ward 8, 500 families will receive $1,100 a month for five months The released results were collected before the coronavirus pandemic had hobbled the U.S. economy, and a second study is expected to be published next year, according to the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED). The findings provide insight into how money can alter a person’s behavior in a crisis such as the pandemic, according to the researchers. The study’s authors said they believe the payment recipients were better able to set goals and have their own agency to seek more stable employment. They were also less anxious and depressed, as well as less likely to feel fatigue or body pain associated with poor emotional health. Recipients, especially those in less-financially stable families, also stretched their resources to help feed their households and others. Tomas Vargas Jr., a recipient in the study, said his overall health improved and he was able to spend more time with his children and wife. Vargas, formerly a part-time supervisor at a warehouse, also found a full-time job once he started receiving regular payments. \"It was a big change in my life,\" Vargas told reporters Wednesday. \"I was very depressed. I was down and out. I was at the bottom. SEED brought me back, gave me that chance, that opportunity.\" Cities ramp up efforts to send direct checks to residents after $15 million donation from Twitter CEO Positive stories in Stockton have already prompted leaders in other cities to consider implementing a similar project: Dozens of mayors have joined an initiative to advocate for guaranteed income, and several pilots in cities including St. Paul, Minn., and Compton, Calif., have already begun. \"The study shows what mayors know: People are working, but the economy isn’t,\" St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said."
